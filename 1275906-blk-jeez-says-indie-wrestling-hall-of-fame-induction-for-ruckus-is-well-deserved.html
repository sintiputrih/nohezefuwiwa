Ruckus is an innovator man. A lot of the guys that have the popular style now, Ruckus is the father of that, and also, even back then, when other guys were getting more recognition than Ruckus, a lot of these guys, they were only good in-ring. Ruckus, not only was he good in the ring, he was a character, you know what I’m saying? He held it all down, you know what I mean? So like, it’s real cool that he’s getting in that Hall of Fame man. He definitely deserves it, definitely. If it was up to me, Ruckus would be a millionaire right now if it was up to me.”</p><p>Speaking about his own condition at this stage in the game, Jeez says he is in the best shape of his life.</p><p>“It’s definitely working out, you know what I’m saying? Eating clean and all that but it’s also, I still have a passion for this. There’s still a lot that I wanna accomplish and over the years, we all go through where we might not like it as much, you know what I’m saying? Because of the negatives that we gotta deal with in this business or whatever but, when we as wrestlers when we get motivated, there’s nothing that can stop us. It’s like now, I feel like I’m in the best shape of my life. I’m putting out the best performances, the best promos and all that. I still got a few years left man, you know what I’m saying? I’m loving this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFwbHJoZmKvrbeMo5yesl2orrq%2FjKKlnaGVYsSzsdKto6Kml2K1orjLZqafZZaWuqZ5yKebrpuknryvecWoqWaqpZi4tr%2BMoqpmr5WhuW6wxKycq66VmQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Now one of the domineering figures in the fashion industry, Victoria was a part of the popular hip-hop group called Spice Girls which fast-tracked her rise to fame.</p><p>The English beauty is also known for being the better half of the famous ex-footballer, David Beckham, following their fairytale wedding on the 4th of July 1999. The wedding had a total of 437 staff working at the reception and was estimated to have cost £500,000 (US$ 823,650).</p><p>Born on April 17, 1974, in Harlow, Essex, England, Victoria Beckham hardly experienced any hardship in life as she was raised in a wealthy family. She graduated from St. Mary’s High School where she discovered her inclination towards a career in music. She further trained herself in modeling and theatre arts. Victoria has been active in the entertainment and fashion industry since 1994.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=details-of-what-she-does-for-a-living></span><strong>Details of What She Does For a Living</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her journey to fame began when she became a part of the group Spice Girls in 1994. She performed as a singer alongside Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Melanie Brown, and Melanie Chisholm. The group went on to launch a successful career in the music industry, giving Victoria her fair share of fame and money. The group’s first single titled “Wannabe” was released in 1996. Victoria was a member of the group until it seized to exist in 2000.</p><p>After the group disbanded, Victoria went solo and subsequently released singles like “Out of Your Mind”, “Not Such an Innocent Girl” and a lot more.</p><p>Seemingly, Victoria realized she wasn’t exploring her horizon as much as she needed to. Thus, she started putting her interest in modeling. While training herself for a modeling career, she discovered her interest in fashion designing as well. Following her debut as a model in London Fashion Week in 2000, Victoria won the hearts of many major fashion brands which is no surprise considering her sleek and elegant looks. As a result, the juicy deals kept coming in.</p><p>Nevertheless, after becoming the face of Rocawear and acting as a British ambassador for Dolce and Gabbana, Victoria decided to take her career to the next level. Subsequently, she launched her career in fashion designing.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=fashion-designing-is-the-major-source-of-her-wealth></span><strong>Fashion Designing Is The Major Source of Her Wealth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2004, Victoria Beckham designed and released high-end jeans, a pair of which retailed at $300 in the USA and its equivalent in other countries. She also ventured into her denim label called DVB Style which was launched in 2006.</p><p>For the most part, she has been excelling in the industry and has launched many more fashion-related lines most of which have remained relevant after so many years. To date, Victoria is regarded as one of the highly acclaimed fashion designers in the world who has kept on growing since she took her first step into the industry. Her career in music, as well as her passion for fashion, helped Victoria raise her financial standing over time.</p><p>In 2007, Victoria Beckham was celebrated as the 52nd richest woman in Britain and the 19th richest persons in the country with her husband David, they had an estimated joint wealth of $225 million. According to The Guardian, Beckham Ventures, a company linked to the Victoria Beckham fashion business, was the best performing brand in the family’s three businesses in 2012. As of 2020, it is believed that Victoria has grown her wealth to a massive $450 million. Her husband is worth as much as they have a combined net worth of $900 million.</p><p>Victoria has also participated in five official documentaries and reality shows about her, including Victoria’s Secrets, Being Victoria Beckham, The Real Beckhams, Victoria Beckham – A Mile In Their Shoes, and Victoria Beckham: Coming to America. Other TV appearances include a cameo appearance in an episode of Ugly Betty, and as a guest judge on Project Runway, Germany’s Next Topmodel, as well as American Idol.&nbsp;All of these helped to make her wealthy but being a fashion designer has been her biggest source of income.</p><p>Meanwhile, Victoria Beckham is not all about the glam and luxury, she also invests hugely in charity. In 2010, her charity work with Save the Children earned her a nomination for the Do Something With Style Award.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-love-story-of-david-and-victoria-beckham></span><strong>The Love Story of David and Victoria Beckham</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Victoria lives a happy married life with her husband David Beckham. Victoria met the soccer legend in a 1997 charity football match. At the time, Beckham was playing for Manchester United while Victoria Adams was a member of the Spice Girls. The moment he saw her, Beck told his friends she was the one he was going to marry. Before then, Victoria saw him on TV and immediately fell for him.</p><p>They started dating and by the next year, their engagement was announced. The couple got married on July 4, 1999, at Luttrellstown Castle, Ireland. The wedding was exclusively covered by OK! magazine. Their union battled with infidelity issues as well as divorce rumors, but they have remained together and stronger to date.</p><p>Many have found it pretty surprising that two decades later, David and Victoria are still holding on strong, something many celebrities seem not to know how to do. One of the main reasons the two are together many years after is the genuine love they have for each other. More so, it is revealed that thanks to their years together, both Posh and Becks have come to understand each other, and that has made it easy for them to hold onto one another. They also share a lot of things in common, including their sense of fashion which has made them arguably the classiest couple in Hollywood.</p><p>Like every celebrity marriage destined to last, the two have come to build strong shoulders against everything that the media is saying about them, including insinuations by the British media that she was not good enough for her husband.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-family-life-revolves-around-david-and-their-kids></span><strong>Her Family Life Revolves Around David and Their Kids</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The couple has come to build a very beautiful family with adorable kids and so they have continued to ensure everything is kept tight for the sake of their family as a whole.

Of course, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">this isn't the first time that Banks has taken aim at Doja</a>, but it might be the most overtly combative example so far.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Doja, I know you hear me calling you, Miss Honey," Azealia Banks' Instagram Live rant against Doja Cat began. "I'm really about to f***ing, like, rip your top off. 'Cause you, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">you be hiding behind that little white girl s**t</a>. Like, that little white girl s**t. But honey, I got the biggest white d**k in America. Like, get ready. Get f***ing ready. You might want to put that wig back on 'cause when I snatch you from the peas, honey, when I get the peas in the kitchen, it's gon' be a wrap. 'Cause you can't rap. Can't rap! I don't know why Dr. Luke told you you could f***ing rap."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-azealia-banks-disses-doja-cat-listen>Azealia Banks Disses Doja Cat: Listen</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, these are some other comments Azealia Banks had made about Doja Cat as of late. "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Doja makes music for ten year olds</a> and is very derivative," she remarked in September of 2022. "Cute girl, but her attempts at witty east coast&nbsp;Roman reloaded flows&nbsp;are pitiful and not in the least amusing. And yes she looked terrible before she lost weight. Cut azealia & doja are miles more culturally important than any of these weak a** white socialites."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Dojacat deserved a Grammy</a>," Azealia Banks actually said in defense of Doja Cat (before turning it around) that month. "It's def the Dr. Luke politic. But tbh the nerve of doja to try and check me via text about body shaming cupcakKe (who&nbsp;threatened to shoot sukihana's three children in the head&nbsp;and also called me a skinny crackhead before I even knew what a cupcakKe was) when doja works for an entire rapist. Maybe that's the karma she gets for trying to get smart with her mother (me) and not staying in a child's place. Hmmmph."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZn90gZVmmLOdkaG2onnBmqWkq12ZvKutjJyYrWWSmrKnedGapa1lmaPAta3Gq5imZZyew6Z5x6KnZqCfpXqvsdas</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

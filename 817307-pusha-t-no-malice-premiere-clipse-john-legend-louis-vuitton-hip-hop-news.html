"I really would hope so," Push told PEOPLE. "I really would love to, man, I really would love to. At this point I feel like we've been in a space a lot together lately, and in those spaces the creativity's just been flowing. So that's where you get songs like you heard at the [Louis Vuitton] fashion show. Really what we've been doing a lot of it is just contributing with our friends. Like, 'OK, Pharrell's a creative director of LV, he needs music for the show.' How would we not show up for that? How would me and my brother not show up for a Nigo album? I think the creativity between us and just the collective of the family that everybody knows where this started from, is something that you can't just stop."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-pusha-t-amp-no-malice-collaborate-with-john-legend>Pusha T & No Malice Collaborate With John Legend</h2></span><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.

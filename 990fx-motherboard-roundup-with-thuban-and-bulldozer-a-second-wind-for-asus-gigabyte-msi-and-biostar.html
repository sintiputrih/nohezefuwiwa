The final three are labeled as optional (one in the middle right above the 24-pin ATX connector, one on the bottom towards the left near the power/reset switches, and another to the left of the 4-pin molex connector above the PCIe slots).&nbsp;&nbsp; For anyone’s needs, that is usually more than enough, unless an enthusiast wishes to make a wind tunnel with some powerful fans.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5714/RoGCrosshairVFormula3D_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The USB 3.0 header is situated beside the 24-pin ATX power connector, in prime position for front panel USB 3.0 ports.&nbsp; Underneath this, we have the six SATA 6 Gbps ports from the chipset at right angles to the board, and another SATA 6 Gbps port from an ASMedia controller.&nbsp; Out of the boards tested today, only the Gigabyte has more SATA 6 Gbps ports available on the board (discounting eSATA).</p><p>Along the bottom of the board are the standard front panel and USB headers.&nbsp; Also here are the Power/Reset buttons, next to an overclock button.&nbsp; This is a one button selection for a system overclock, equivalent to the ‘Fast’ overclock setting in the ASUS software.&nbsp; What is a little disappointing is that there is no two-digit debug on board for diagnostics – should overclockers use this board, it is often a handy tool to have.&nbsp; Overclockers do have other options though – the iROG and ROG Connect options are valid on this board.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5714/_MG_4758_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In the bottom left we find one of the primary marketing features of the Crosshair V Formula – the audio solution.&nbsp; On around 98% of modern chipset motherboards available for consumers, we typically see a Realtek solution, varying from the ALC887 up to the ALC898.&nbsp; On the rare occasion, we get something more – as it is here with the Crosshair V Formula, which sports the X-Fi 2 SupremeFX audio solution.&nbsp; Personally, I am not an audiophile, however out of the usual marketing bumpf that comes from corporate entities; this is one which should be advertised.</p><p>PCIe layout is designed to maximize airflow and GPU lanes – from the top, an x16, an x1, an x8, a PCI, an x16 (x8 when the x8 is populated), and an x4.&nbsp; This gives tri-card users enough space to put three cards in and still use all the headers at the bottom of the board – but only just.&nbsp; Why do I say only just?&nbsp; Well, the user has to ideally populate these ports before plugging in the second card.&nbsp; My case in point is to deal with AMD’s all-in-one liquid cooler, which uses a USB port onboard to power the pump.&nbsp; With this connector in, I placed a second GPU in the board, which essentially locked the pump connector in place, almost impossible to remove without taking the second GPU out first.&nbsp; If a user has three GPUs on board, then they all need to be taken out to put anything like this connector into the USB power ports.&nbsp; It is an obscure issue (depending on how many people use these type of coolers or USB headers), but it is here nonetheless.&nbsp; Perhaps it is time for motherboard manufacturers to put a USB header next to the 24-pin ATX connector?</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5714/_MG_4770_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The IO back panel is fully featured – we start with a combination PS/2 port above a pair of USB 3.0 ports in blue.&nbsp; Next to this is the Clear CMOS button, alongside a pair of USB 2.0 ports above an eSATA 6 Gbps port.&nbsp; We also have a SPDIF output, another pair of USB 3.0 ports, gigabit Ethernet, four more USB 2.0 ports (the one in white is the ROG Connect port), and a set of audio jacks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIJ4fZNocHJolq16rrvToZyrmp%2BWv6V50aisp5ylpXq4tdOhZK2gpZeur3nAp5tmmqWhuaW72Z6pZpldqLKku82dZLChnpl6p7vRZpisraNitKqzwJuwrZ1dosCqecCnm2aamaTAta3RaGk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

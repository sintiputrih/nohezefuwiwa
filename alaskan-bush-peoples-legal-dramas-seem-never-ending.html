The two accusers were Jessica Jurges, who used to be a personal assistant for the family, and Shelly Dawn, Matt's manager. Although <a href=#>The Sun</a> reported the DA in charge of the case decided not to prosecute, both women decided to go public with their allegations.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>"Matt eventually persuaded me to get in and he was like a shark. He ripped my bathing suit off. Wouldn't let go of me. I said no probably a million times," said Jurges. She added that it was Dawn who was finally able to get Matt away from her. Two days later, he assaulted Dawn in the same house. "He knew that I had a hip replacement and he knew that my legs aren't as strong as the rest of my body. And that's how it happened. I couldn't ward him off because my hips were weak," Dawn stated.</p><p dir=ltr>Matt claimed he was drunk at the time of both reported incidents and went back to rehab shortly afterwards. Per text message transcripts obtained by The Sun, Matt's brothers Bear and Gabe were in communication with Jurges following the alleged assault and apologized on behalf of their brother. "Also no part of any of what happened was your fault! Don't blame yourself," texted Bear. According to <a href=#>The Sun</a>, Matt has been estranged from his family ever since and is no longer a part of the show.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.

Trouble squeezing your daily essentials into a pair of leggings? We’ve all been there! Workout wear is great for many reasons, but when it comes to storage, it’s seriously lacking. That’s why we’ve been on the hunt for a pair that have pockets substantial enough to hold everything — including our large iPhones!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that’s not all </a>shoppers are raving about — the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quality of the material</a> is said to be amazing, and the reason for the pants’ fabulous fit. They are high-waisted and feature a thick waistband that smooths the tummy area. The pockets may be deep but they aren’t intrusive — you won’t even notice their presence! As a bonus, there’s also a hidden pocket in the waistband where you can hold smaller items like keys or lip balm.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">flare pant legs</a> are super flattering, and also allow for extra breathability. These yoga pants come in five standard shades: black, navy blue, deep red and two different shades of grey. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">material has four-way stretch</a> and it isn’t sheer. These yoga pants are designed to move with your body, which can make for a more enjoyable workout!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bovodo-Womens-Bootcut-Yoga-Pants-Gray.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bovodo Women’s Bootcut Yoga Pants</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$25</a>, available at Amazon!

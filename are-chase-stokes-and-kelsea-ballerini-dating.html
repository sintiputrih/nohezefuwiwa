Speculation began on Jan. 13 when the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Outer Banks </a>star posted a photo dump on Instagram that included a candid shot of the two watching a football game together. The photo is taken from the back but Stokes cleared up any doubt as to who the mystery woman was by tagging the country singer in the pic. Ballerini then commented on the post, ‚ÄúGo vols üôà,‚Äù referring to the University of Tennessee team.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=659 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>A few days later, the Nasvhille-based singer posted a short clip on TikTok responding to speculative comments made by the gossip Instagram account Deuxmoi. ‚ÄúI know, I know,‚Äù Ballerini says while laughing and shaking her head, ‚Äústop reading, stop looking. But, what is happening guys? What is this? Let‚Äôs not do this.‚Äù In the video, Ballerini shares a screenshot speculating on her relationship with Stokes and a mean-spirited comment saying the singer is ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù to date Stokes because she‚Äôs ‚Äúconsistently asking out the manager of soho house nash when she comes in all the time after last call.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.tiktok.com/@kelseaballerini/video/7189300854460091691</figure><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=581 data-current-count=881 data-injectable=true>On Jan. 17, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> approached Stokes and asked him questions about the relationship rumors. While he didn‚Äôt directly confirm the two are official, he thanked the TMZ photographer when told they make a cute couple and said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having a good time, and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say.‚Äù Further fueling the rumors, the two were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> holding hands at a Nashville music venue and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">seen </a>sharing a hug at LAX. If anything, a trip to the dreaded airport (any Angeleno knows LAX is not an easy trek) proves they‚Äôre an item, but are the two actually dating?</p><h2 id=h-are-chase-stokes-and-kelsey-ballerini-a-couple data-injectable=false>Are Chase Stokes and Kelsey Ballerini a couple?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@kelseaballerini href=#>@kelseaballerini</a><p>Replying to @amanda_joy_</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Kelsea Ballerini" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Kelsea Ballerini</a></figure><p data-characters=816 data-current-count=1116 data-injectable=true>The pair have yet to officially define their relationship but they‚Äôve dropped some pretty substantial hints they‚Äôre seeing each other. In an interview published Feb. 8 in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> magazine, Stokes stops short of confirming he and Ballerini are a couple, saying, ‚ÄúKelsea is a lovely, lovely girl. She‚Äôs great. We‚Äôre having a good time.‚Äù The same day, Ballerini posted a TikTok video in reply to a comment asking Stokes to ‚Äúcome get your girl.‚Äù In the video, the ‚Äúhalf of my hometown‚Äù singer sips tea in bed while the camera pans to a tattooed arm next to her before quickly returning to a smirking Ballerini. Many in the comments recognized the tattoos as belonging to Stokes and took this as Ballerini‚Äôs way of ‚Äúsoft-launching‚Äù the couple.</p><p data-characters=668 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>On Feb. 13, Stokes posted an Instagram story congratulating Ballerini on releasing her joint EP and short film, Rolling Up the Welcome Mat. He captioned a photo of the two smiling at each other in an elevator, ‚ÄúSo proud of you, your heart, and your beautiful soul. Congrats kels ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù This was the closest we‚Äôve gotten to the two officially recognizing their relationship until Feb. 20, when the Call Her Daddy podcast <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> a teaser of an upcoming interview with Ballerini, where the country star confirms she‚Äôs in a relationship. While we can guess who she‚Äôs with, we won‚Äôt know until the podcast episode comes out Wednesday.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>Both Stokes and Ballerini recently got out of public relationships; Stokes and Outer Banks costar Madelyn Cline <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">broke up in 2021</a> and Ballerini <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">divorced country singer Morgan Evans</a> last year. Whether or not they choose to confirm, we wish the new couple nothing but happiness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Sus7GMnJ%2Baq5ViwLW7yp6qZpmemXqsscusnJplkpa5rbHRoqWiZZSWwaq6xmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

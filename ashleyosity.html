However, she did not post anything on the channel until 2014. Her first video on the channel was ‘Apocalyptica | Apocalyptic Role-Play Minecraft Survival w/ SheWolfDeadly | Episode 1’. The channel is dedicated to various forms of ‘Minecraft’ gameplays, such as ‘Let’s Plays’ and ‘Role-Plays’.</p><p>Moreover, in the ‘Role-Play’ category, Ashley has created several video series. Every video series has a different story, often revolving around Ashley’s real-life experiences. For instance, the series ‘Yandere High School’ features a group of four friends in their first year at ‘Minecraft High School.’</p><p>Another episodic video series on ‘Ashleyosity’ is based on ‘Roblox.’ Some of them are ‘Roblox Fairies & Mermaids Winx High’ and ‘Roblox Royale High!’ Most of the episodes from the life simulation game series have earned millions of views.</p><p>Moreover, ‘Yandere High School | FIRST DAY!

Previously titled ‘SimsWithAsh,’ the channel is dedicated to the fourth part of the life simulation video-game series ‘The Sims.’ The channel hosts ‘The Sims 4 Gameplay,’ ‘The Sims 4 Builds,’ and other ‘The Sims’-related content. Ashley has been avid ‘The Sims player since 2012 when her mother bought her the first ‘The Sims game.</p><p>She was intrigued by the game and spent countless hours playing it. Ashley now has the whole collection of ‘The Sims’ (including the spin-offs) games, single expansion, “goodies,” and game packs of both the console and the hand-held versions.

It is primarily a vlog channel, through which Ashley and Chris share their personal space with their viewers. However, the channel is similar to that of Ashley’s first channel.</p><p>The vlogs on the channel are published in the form of episodes and under the name ‘CrashLife,’ which originates from “Crash Nation,” the term that refers to the pair’s fan base. Therefore, ‘Crash’ represents both their names (Chris + Ashley = Crash).</p><p>Apart from creating content for her gaming-related channels, Ashley collaborates with Chris on other online gaming ventures. She often appears on ‘Chrisandthemike,’ Chris’s channel dedicated to the ‘Roblox’ game ‘Jailbreak.’ The two also record videos for ‘Crash Nation.’</p><p>Chris and Ashley, along with their fellow gamers Sean (aka Garlian) and Carlo, moved in for the first time after Chris disabled two of his collaborative channels.

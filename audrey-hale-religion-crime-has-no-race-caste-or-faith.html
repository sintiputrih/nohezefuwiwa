Although no one knows for how many years she was a part of the school.&nbsp;</p><p>Hale never discussed his religion publicly, so it is hard to make an assumption about the shooter’s religious beliefs. However, Hale’s mother, Norma Hale, is a devoted Christian who works at a Nashville-based church, The Village Chapel.</p><p>Norma is a coordinator at the Chapel and was frequently seen boasting about her children’s achievements and spiritual upbringing.&nbsp;</p><p>A neighbor of the family told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ABC News</a> that Audrey Hale lived at the family’s home with Hale’s parents, who the neighbor described as “very nice” and “very religious.”</p><p>On January 28, 2019, Norma wrote, “found this in a devotional book I loaned to Audrey,” with a heart emoji at the end of the sentence and a photo that shows “I (love) God” written on the page.</p><p>It appears that Hale and her brother were brought up in a religious household and were connected to the religion of Christianity through their mother, Norma.&nbsp;</p><p>It is believed that Audrey Hale was a born Christian, but was the transgender a practicing Christian at the time of the attack is a question that is yet to be answered.&nbsp;</p><p>Hale’s horrible act of shooting innocent people should not be attributed or connected to her religion at any cost. Religious people, no matter which religion they belong to, do not commit such gruesome and horrid crimes.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to remember that in today’s day and age, crime has no race, caste, or faith. Crimes like the one committed by Hale are above the scope of religion.&nbsp;</p><p>After digging into Hale’s personal life, it was disclosed that the deceased shooter was an animal lover and a good person.&nbsp;</p><p>Hale’s parent’s neighbors said that they knew Audrey as someone very lovely and very religious.</p><p>The whole <a href=#>family</a> had a spiritual vibe attached to them, so it is very hard to believe that Audrey would do something like this.&nbsp;</p><p>Audrey’s suspected resentment towards the school indicates that her parents put her into that school.</p><p>Her parent’s decision to get her admitted into a Christian school could be seen as a way of keeping their daughter close to their religion.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCt1J2pnrFdna6tsYyrnKWhl568r3nCq6CmnV2drrR5zahkq5mTmnqkrdKtnGanomKzorXToWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

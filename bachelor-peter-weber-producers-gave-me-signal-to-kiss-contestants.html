During an appearance on Us‘ “Here for the Right Reasons” podcast, the 29-year-old pilot questioned his title as the Bachelor who kissed the most women on night one.
“I don’t know if I actually am the Bachelor that did that!” Peter said, adding that he thinks production just included all of his night one makeouts."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You don’t see this on camera, like, so many times, I was being given this [signal] the entire time, like, they wanted that and hey, if I was feeling it with the girl, I was gonna go in for it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Bachelor-Peter-Weber-Says-Producers-Give-A-Sign-When-Its-A-Good-Time-To-Kiss-Promo.jpg><p>When asked for clarification about the hand signal, the pilot added with a laugh, “Producers, if they think it’s a good time to kiss, they’ll, like, tap their fingers or they have their phone that says, ‘Kiss.’”</p><p>He continued: “The first night, though, it’s usually [the girls’] names behind their head, just to kind of remind me, and then it’ll segue from that to, ‘All right, you should do this, we think it’s a good time.’ … And then I got labeled, I guess, the most-kissed Bachelor.”</p><p>Bachelor Nation will recall Peter’s 2020 season finale showing his engagement to <a href=#><strong>Hannah Ann Sluss</strong></a>. Their romance didn’t last, however, with the “Bachelors in the City” podcast cohost<a href=#> ending things while the show was still airing.</a> It was then implied that he and runner-up <a href=#><strong>Madison Prewett</strong></a> were going to give things a shot, but the twosome opted to go their separate ways two days after the live After the Final Rose.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“People ask, like, do I regret the way things went or doing the show and honestly, no, that’s the honest answer. Do I wish it could have ended up better, like, do I wish I was engaged to someone right now? Yes. And [do I wish] it would have worked out? 100 percent,” the Bachelorette alum told Us. “But that was me just in the moment, making the decisions I thought were the best in the moment, trying to follow my heart, be true to myself. … Even though it seems, like, a little messy or whatnot, it is so much going on. I don’t regret it because I was doing what I thought I should be doing.”</p><p>Peter,<a href=#> who dated contestant <strong>Kelley Flanagan</strong> for 10 months</a> before they split for good in February, added that he wishes he could’ve “saved everyone that did get hurt in the process” the pain caused by the ending.</p><p>“But you can’t go through life, like, ‘Oh, it turned out not the exact way I wanted, so I regret that now,'” he concluded. “You’re gonna go crazy living life like that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2BjKmcrZ2iYsSmrsSrZKmqn5nCpLHRrGSgmaaaeq6xjKygoKaRoXq1u4ykoKyrXZi8r8DErKuapqSofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

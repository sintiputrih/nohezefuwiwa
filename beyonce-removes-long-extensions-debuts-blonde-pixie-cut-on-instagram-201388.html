Beyonce shared three pictures of her cropped coif with fans, though she offered no explanation as to why she decided to forgo long blonde locks.

That look, however, was a wig. “Once I put on that blond wig and those thick eyebrows, I felt much more natural in her skin,” she explained to <a href=#>ELLE</a> in 2010.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Beyonce, whose mother <strong>Tina Knowles</strong> once owned a hair salon in Texas, has become known for experimenting with different hairstyles over the years. “I’m still always doing something to my hair — cutting layers, or bleaching it, or taking it upon myself to copy fashionable hairstyles without knowing the necessary techniques,” she told the magazine. “A couple of weeks ago, I cut my own bangs and put highlights in the front. When my stylist saw me, she was like, ‘What did you do?!’ I did a pretty good job, but she still had to fix it. We’re always joking that I’m a frustrated hairdresser.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=353 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="bey 2" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The singer — mom to <strong>Blue</strong> <strong>Ivy</strong>, 19 months, with husband <a href=#><strong>Jay Z</strong></a>, 43 — said her biggest hair regret is cutting her ponytails off as a child. “I saw my mom doing extensions, so I thought she’d be able to put them back on,” she explained. “Thankfully I had separated my hair into quarters and I only cut off the front two ponytails. Afterward I had to have really thick bangs for a while.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnamku6SxjKucpqemmsBuuM6nnmadqKmyr7%2FIqKWsZZSar7bA0maZpaeembJuvMixoJ5lk6rBbrvNZqCnq6SWtLOtzGZpaWljbYVw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

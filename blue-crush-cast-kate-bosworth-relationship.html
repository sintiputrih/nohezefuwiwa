She was only 18 when she was cast in the 2003 surfing movie. While it wasn't the biggest movie of the year, it certainly was profitable and launched the careers of many of its stars, including Michelle Rodriguez.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But anyone who knows anything about Hollywood is more than aware that sets that launch numerous careers at once can be breeding grounds for infighting, drama, and bullying. But was that the case on the set of Blue Crush?</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Vulture</a>, Kate revealed what she really thought of the women and men she had to spend time with while making the movie.</p><h2 id=kate-bosworth-39-s-relationship-with-michelle-rodriguez-and-sanoe-lake>Kate Bosworth's Relationship With Michelle Rodriguez And Sanoe Lake</h2><p>Many <a href=#>Fast and Furious</a> fans <a href=#>may forget that Michelle Rodriguez was in Blue Crush</a>. After all, the movie was relatively small in comparison to her other works. But Michelle's contribution to the success of Blue Crush is immeasurable. Much of the plot fell on the shoulders of the three main women and their authentic connection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Michelle, Sanoe [Lake], and I lived in a house together in Sunset Beach, so our friendship [in the movie] is just an extension of our everyday life," Kate Bosworth explained in her interview with Vulture.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How 'Fast And The Furious' Star Michelle Rodriguez Stays In Shape</a></span></p><p>"Obviously, it was very scripted, but there’s a lot of moments where we were just messing around. I was eating so many calories — Michelle would come home from hanging out in Honolulu, and I would wake up in the middle of the night, and she would walk in on me eating this huge salad bowl of ice cream."</p><p>Kate went on to say that their relationship went so much deeper than the fun they had.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jonah Hill Flaunts Tats and Surfing Skills, Keeping Fit After Impressive Weight Loss</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We were all like sisters, and we still feel that way. It really was that kind of life-changing experience where whenever we see each other, it’s like being reunited with family. We’re very different people, but we used to always say we’re like the perfect points of a triangle."</p><h2 id=kate-bosworth-39-s-relationship-with-matt-davis>Kate Bosworth's Relationship With Matt Davis</h2><p>There's so much that works about Kate Bosworth and Matt Davis' characters in Blue Crush. Their dynamic is easily one of the film's highlights.</p><p>"[My relationship with Matt] was so natural, so easy, but also kind of perfectly awkward in the ways that were necessary," Kate admitted.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Vin Diesel Shares Photo Of Him And Onscreen Wife, Michelle Rodriguez To Hype Up 'F9'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While many believe that the dynamic between the three women is the most important relationship in Blue Crush, Kate claimed that Anne Maire and Matt's connection was her throughline.</p><p>"If I’m honest, I feel like the love story of the movie is really the friendship. In hindsight, I realized how important and honest the love between us was. That pulse in the movie, I think, is what moved so many young women. It was the inspiration to go out there and fulfill your dreams, but it was also a real love story of friendship that I think is equally as important and has resonated so deeply."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-bosworth-on-filming-the-funniest-scene-in-blue-crush>Kate Bosworth On Filming The Funniest Scene In Blue Crush</h2><p>While filming all of the surfing scenes was the greatest challenge for Kate while making Blue Crush, the funniest moment also proved difficult. This is, of course, the scene where her character is working as a maid and has to school a few football players on how to properly dispose of a prophylactic.</p><p>"The c*ndom part, I remember shooting that pretty quickly, actually, but the part that was quite brutal for Michelle, Sanoe, and me was the cleanup prior to that scene in the suite," Kate admitted.</p><p>"We didn’t rehearse any of it because [co-writer and director] John [Stockwell] did a lot of handheld so that we could really have the space and be really authentic as they follow us around. There was a fly-on-the-wall style to it that allowed you to really be with the characters. We had walked it through, but it was super-loose, and we didn’t know anything that was gonna be in that suite."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So when Kate and her co-stars actually shot the scene, they were utterly surprised by what they found in the room.</p><p>"I’m sure [John] used the first take. Sanoe was so funny and pure in her reactions, and I just remember her discovering all the gross things John had placed throughout the room. If you were to watch that movie back and really look at that scene, I’m sure you could see me on the verge of laughter a lot of the time because her reactions were so funny. She’d never been in a movie before, so she wasn’t really differentiating between things not being real and being real."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZpa2VYrCzwdKhZJyZo6l6rK3TnmSbp6OsvLPAx2apnqSRqbawutKhoKln</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

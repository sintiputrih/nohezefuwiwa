It makes sense that blue whales — the largest animals on the planet — have huge mouths.
But even after seeing the 200-ton animals that these mouths belong to, the enormity of these fish-guzzling caverns is still shocking.
These mouths stretch far down the animals’ bodies in blubbery extensions that allow them to ingest their weight in water and fish."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So whales have to be picky about what particular schools of krill are worth the effort.</p><p>When they’ve decided on a target, they turn on their sides, open their mouths — rapidly decreasing their speed from about 6.7 miles per hour to 1.1 miles per hour — and swallow as much of the pack as they can.</p><p>They then use the comb-like features of their mouths to filter all of the fish into their stomachs.</p><p>Though this hunting process has been understood for quite some time, researchers have never gotten a really great look at it.</p><p>But with new drone technology that allows the whales to be filmed without disturbing them — researchers at Oregon State have now captured stunning footage of the entire blue whale dining experience.</p><p>“So this is something we often see from the boat and we see splashing and we can tell the animal turns on its side,” Leigh Torres, a marine ecologist who led the team capturing the footage, says in the video. “But with the drone we were able to get this remarkable new perspective.”</p><p>The video also shows the whale ignoring a smaller school of fish, preferring to save the mouth-opening energy.</p><p>“It would be like me driving a car and braking every 100 yards, then accelerating again,” Torres said in a press release. “Whales need to be choosy about when to apply the brakes to feed on a patch of krill.”</p><p>Torres noted that this new level of understanding might help humans better protect the endangered whales.</p><p>“Lots of human activity can influence krill availability,” she told <a href=#>National Geographic</a>. “We pretty much know having some krill in the water doesn’t make good habitat. There has to be krill density.”</p><p>Next, see <a href=#>why killer whales went on an unprecedented murder spree in Monterey, California</a>.

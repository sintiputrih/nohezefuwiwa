The former Bachelorette contestant <a href=#>took to Instagram</a> on Tuesday, July 21, to offer up an explanation as to why he and Bachelorette star <strong>Britt Nilsson</strong> parted ways.</p><p>The rocker, 33, shared a sweet photo of himself on the beach with Nilsson, for whom he left the current, 11th season of the ABC dating show after it was announced that<strong> Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong> would be the next Bachelorette. Bristowe narrowly edged out Nilsson at the beginning of the season, which was the first to introduce the twist of two bachelorettes. While Toops and Nilsson shared a connection, their relationship ended this past May.</p><p>Toops, who was noticeably absent from Monday's <a href=#>"Men Tell All" special</a> of The Bachelorette, used his Instagram photo to shed some light on what happened with Nilsson, 27.&nbsp;</p><p>"Since I wasn't on 'Men Tell All' to clear things up, and since a lot of people have been asking lately, 'If you & @brittkarolina are saying such nice things about each other, then WHY didn't it work out?'" he began. "In light of that, I thought I'd help clear the air and give you the 4 real (behind the scenes) reasons it didn't work out."</p><p>"1. We had no real celebrity couple mashup name.. Britt(y), Brad(itt). See, there was almost no chance. This was probably the beginning of the end when we realized this," Toops joked. "2. Britt is afraid of heights, and not only am I afraid of heights, but I'm actually afraid of her being afraid of heights. That obviously couldn't work."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Toops, who is apparently still close friends with Nilsson, does not seem to be too heartbroken by the split. He went on to offer two more humorous explanations for the failed relationship.</p><p>"3. Once we left the show, they didn't give us any roses. How are we suppose to figure this thing out without any roses? [for you haters out there, I did actually buy her flowers..]" he wrote. "4. Apparently I needed some more inspiration for my next record, because we all know that break-up records are the records you can't stop listening to (ex. Sam Smith – "In the Lonely Hour", Adele – "21", Coldplay – "Ghost Stories"). Stay tuned."</p><p>"Anyway, I hope this helps," the musician added. "Even though it's sad that Britt & I are no longer together, I want to thank everyone for all the love & support you've shown us. She's a special girl and deserves nothing but the best. I'm glad we're still friends (notice the side hug in the pic ). Peace & Love!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpGZxm7AzqinrGWVrb2trcinqmaroKG2tXnFq6amZZKWsKmxy6ipnqykmnqjvsitq2ammaHAtLvNZmlpaWVnf3h7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

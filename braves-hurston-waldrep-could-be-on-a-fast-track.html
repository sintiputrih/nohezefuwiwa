He helped the Gators reach the College World Series in 2023, when he finished third in the nation with 156 strikeouts.</p><p>The Braves had been following Waldrep since he was in high school in South Georgia.</p><p>The splitter is undoubtedly Waldrep’s most effective pitch. Shah said the pitch “has a chance to miss a lot of bats at the big league level.” His fastball command is a work in progress and will largely determine how quickly he reaches the majors.</p><p>Four of Waldrep’s eight starts last season were made at Double-A or Triple-A. That type of rapid ascent indicates that he could be on the fast track to Atlanta.</p><p>It’s easy to envision Waldrep as a long-term piece in the Braves’ rotation. <strong>Spencer Strider</strong> is signed on a lengthy deal, but lefthander <strong>Max Fried</strong> is a free agent following the season. Charlie Morton is 40 years old and pitching year to year.</p><p>Certainly, Waldrep could become an integral part of the Braves’ rotation soon.</p><p><strong>SHORT NOTES</strong></p><p>— The progress of righthander <strong>Owen Murphy</strong> will be interesting to watch this season. The Braves drafted him 20th overall in 2022, with the two-way high school star committing to just pitching. This will be Murphy’s second full minor league season after he posted a 4.72 ERA across 21 starts in Low-A Augusta and High-A Rome last season.</p><p>— Righthander <strong>Drue Hackenberg</strong> will begin his first full season with the organization after it drafted him in the second round last summer. He made two scoreless starts in Low-A Augusta before making his Double-A debut. The Virginia Tech product could ascend quickly. He excels at getting ground balls.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o63SnpmapJyWuqa%2ByJyYZ5ufony0wM6roJ6rX5e%2FosLErGShraKowbC6jLCYpZyimr1ur86uo51lkpp6sLqMmmSfmaOperW%2BwJyiaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

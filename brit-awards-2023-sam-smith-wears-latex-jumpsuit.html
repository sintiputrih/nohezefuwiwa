I look forward to a time where awards shows can be reflective of the society we live in. Let’s celebrate everybody, regardless of gender, race, age, ability, sexuality and class,” Smith wrote via Instagram in March 2021, calling the Brits an integral piece of their career since winning the Rising Star Award in 2014.</p><p class=p1>By that November, the show’s producers eliminated gender-specific awards categories.</p><p class=p1>“It is important that the Brits continue to evolve and aim to be as inclusive as possible,”&nbsp;<strong>Tom March</strong>, the former Brits chair, said in a statement at the time. “It feels completely the right&nbsp;time to celebrate the achievements of artists&nbsp;for the music that they create, and the work that they do, irrespective of gender.”</p><p class=p1>Smith’s Brits appearance comes less than one week after they and Petras, 30, <a href=#>made history at the 2023 Grammys</a>.

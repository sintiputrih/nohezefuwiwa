Can’t Hardly Wait captured the ultimate ’90s nostalgia as it bid farewell to the graduating seniors of Huntington Hillside High School — and sent them off with one last rager.
The 1998 film centers on a group of students determined to cross off one last achievement on their end-of-high-school bucket lists. Preston Meyers (Ethan Embry) plans to confess his four-year crush to Amanda Beckett (Jennifer Love Hewitt), the most popular girl in school after she’s been dumped by her jock boyfriend Mike Dexter (Peter Facinelli)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Can’t Hardly Wait&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">captured the ultimate ’90s nostalgia</a> as it bid farewell to the graduating seniors of&nbsp;Huntington Hillside High School — and sent them off with one last rager.</p><p>The 1998 film centers on a group of students determined to cross off one last achievement on their end-of-high-school bucket lists. Preston Meyers (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ethan Embry</strong></a>) plans to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confess his four-year crush</a> to Amanda Beckett (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jennifer Love Hewitt</strong></a>), the most popular girl in school after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she’s been dumped by her jock boyfriend</a> Mike Dexter (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Peter Facinelli</strong></a>).</p><p>Meanwhile, class nerd William Lichter (<strong>Charlie Korsmo</strong>) infiltrates the party in an elaborate plot to seek revenge on Mike after four years of bullying. Wannabe rapper Kenny Fisher (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Seth Green</strong></a>) hopes he can lose his virginity by the end of the night. Outsider Denise Fleming (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lauren Ambrose</strong></a>) is dragged to the party by her best friend, Preston, but finds herself spending the evening with an unexpected party guest.</p><p><strong>Deborah Kaplan</strong> and <strong>Harry Elfont</strong> cowrote and co-directed the movie, which shared the same title as the 1987 song by The Replacements. Can’t Hardly Wait marked the first time Hewitt stepped into a role where she was portrayed as a bombshell lead. Kaplan told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">International Business Times</a> in 2018 that Hewitt was ready to take on a new character persona.</p><p>“I think she was excited because she had always sort of played the best friend and the sort of mouthy girl and not really the object of desire,” Kaplan said at the time. “Even in I Know What You Did Last Summer, which was a big movie, they always put her in overalls or glasses, she was just kind of the side chick, in a way. But in this one, she got to be the girl that everybody wanted.”</p><p>Embry, for his part, auditioned for the movie but was offered the part of William Lichter. He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VH1</a> in 2013 that he turned down the role because he was set on playing the leading man.</p><p>“It had been a while that I had the opportunity to play the ‘guy that gets the girl,’” Embry said at the time. “I had done those roles when I was a lot younger and this was the first time that someone would see me as a lead. I wanted to play the guy who gets the girl. That was sort of the driving thing.”</p><p>Although Hewitt and Embry were established names before Can’t Hardly Wait was released, numerous actors appeared in the film before their big breaks including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jason Segel</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jaime Pressly</strong></a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Selma Blair.</strong></a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hewitt revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she had her eye on making a sequel</a> to the teen comedy in 2015.&nbsp;“Can’t Hardly Wait reunion movie anyone? Let’s get them to make it!” she tweeted at the time.</p><p>Four years later, the Party of Five alum shared on <strong>Danny Pellegrino</strong>’s podcast, “Everything Iconic,” that she was actively working on the film’s release as a director.</p><p>Scroll down to see where the cast of Can’t Hardly Wait is today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BYrq%2FAjKGYq5ycrnq4rcitZJyZo6l6uLTEq5xmmaKaerW0xLJkp6enZLeiv86nZKydl5q5bsDHnmSwmaSav66xy6ilZp%2Blrnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

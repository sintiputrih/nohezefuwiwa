One thing peripheral vendors have been notoriously awful about has been software. I was never especially happy with the software Corsair uses, to say nothing of Thermaltake's and even Logitech's older software. The old G500 used the SetPoint software kit, separate from their gaming software, but with the new G series, all of the new mice and keyboards fall under a single unified software umbrella.

I was never especially happy with the software Corsair uses, to say nothing of Thermaltake's and even Logitech's older software. The old G500 used the SetPoint software kit, separate from their gaming software, but with the new G series, all of the new mice and keyboards fall under a single unified software umbrella. This is immensely appreciated, as most vendors are using separate drivers and software for each of their products.</p><p>As it turns out, the G-series software is pretty good, too, and remarkably simple. Someone at Logitech seems to have decided that existing software was too clunky or not functional enough, because this software is lightweight and incredibly easy to use.</p><p align=center><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/6855/Small-(3-of-3).jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Strangely, the G100s is the only one of the three mice tested that has more than one configuration page; one page handles the DPI levels while the second handles the limited button configuration. It seems really bizarre that they would take that approach with this mouse, as it's unnecessarily involved. Nonetheless, the software is very simple and intuitive, something that will be consistent across these three products.</p><p align=center><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/6855/Small-(2-of-3).jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When you get to the G500s, you see most of the same functions as the G100s but lose some granularity in the sensor; the "Advanced" settings are all gone. The first window actually lets you choose between storing your settings in the mouse's on-board memory or storing them in software; from there it takes you to the single configuration window. Changing a button's setting is as easy as clicking on that button in the window, where a dropbox lets you choose between using the default or going to a page that lets you assign a macro, key, or basic mouse function (including multimedia controls.)</p><p align=center><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/6855/Small-(1-of-3).jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Finally, the G700s ups the ante one more time by allowing you to store and toggle between up to five different profiles, but other than that it's essentially identical to the configuration options for the G500s. It does add the ability to choose a power mode, and I found the Max Gaming mode was enough to make the wireless connection undetectable; under the other two, there's just a little bit of perceptible lag even with the mouse right next to the receiver.</p><p>This is really clean, well made software and a major step forward for Logitech. If it loses anything, it's that it's not as robust as the ridiculously configurable Kone mice from ROCCAT. Those mice use illumination to identify different profiles, and they're frankly still going to be almost ideal for users who want to get as much utility out of their mice as humanly possible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIN5gZRompqoo6q5pnnRnq2inadiubCzyK2cnKCjYrRyfI%2BsZKBtYGXAbq3NnWSgb2BlwG6zwKagp59doraksY5u</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

That is, until now.</p><p>As gender norms continue to crumble, men are expressing their sense of style and beauty through bright, fresh manis.</p><p>There are a few stars who have only worn the look once or twice like OGs Depp and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a>, but others are fully taking it on as their own. Most notably, British pop star Styles.</p><p>The former One Direction band member has stepped out time and time again with some sort of new — and trendy — designs. He’s worn everything from single hues to tonal manicures to actual standout nail art. While promoting his 2019 album Fine Lines, he showcased bright-yellow smiley faces in a video. And when performing a week later, nail artist Britney Tokyo created a design with one hand featuring the album’s title in the same color theme and the other with different playful fruits as a reference to its songs.</p><p>“What women wear. What men wear. For me it’s not a question of that,” the singer said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>. “If I see a nice shirt and get told, ‘But it’s for ladies.’ I think: ‘Okaaaay? Doesn’t make me want to wear it less though.’ I think the moment you feel more comfortable with yourself, it all becomes a lot easier.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>From Styles intricate designs to Depp’s vibrant finish, keep scrolling to see all the celebrity men who have rocked some nail polish.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvCnqOemqKewbp5zJ6lZq%2BYpHqxrcinq2asmJq2s3nNmqClq12irq2xjKaYp6GTqr%2BmedOrnKecX6%2BupHnEn6mopl1ufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

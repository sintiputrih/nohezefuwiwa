While cereal and milk and strawberries are fairly common kitchen staples, some stars have gone decades without ever giving them a try.</p><p>For example, <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>’s first foray with <a href=#>cereal and milk</a> occurred in September 2018 when the entrepreneurial reality star was 21 years old. Though cereal and milk is a popular (and tasty) pair, Jenner had always preferred dry cereal with no milk at all. Still, when she tried the combo of Cinnamon Toast Crunch and regular milk for the first time, she boldly called it “life-changing,” which led to some harmless teasing from <a href=#><strong>Seth Rogen</strong></a> and other social media stars.</p><p>Believe it or not, Jenner is hardly the only celeb to wait a decade or two to sink her teeth into an ordinary food. In a 2016 interview, NFL star and disciplined dieter <a href=#><strong>Tom Brady</strong></a> revealed he had yet to consume a strawberry and had no interest in tasting one. “I’ve never eaten a strawberry in my life,” he said at the time. “I have no desire to do that.”</p><p>Still despite that bold declaration, Brady <a href=#>tasted his first strawberry</a> during a March 2018 stint on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and deemed the fruit “not bad.”</p><p><a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> star <a href=#><strong>Charli Burnett</strong></a> used her time on the show <a href=#>to challenge her past relationship with food.</a></p><p>“I can’t sit behind this anymore, I can’t have this cloud over my head,” the SUR waitress told costar <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a> during a November 2021 episode. Burnett previously revealed that she struggled with trying new food because of how the topic was approached when she was a child.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Bravo personality <a href=#>credited her boyfriend, <strong>Corey Loftus</strong></a>, for helping her face the issues. “For 17 years, I ate the same food: pizza, PB&J, quesadillas, until I met Corey. And Corey was like, ‘Absolutely not. We’re not eating the same thing all the f–king time,'” she recalled during season 9 of Vanderpump Rules.</p><p>Burnett reflected on her progress after hosting a gathering where her friends brought a variety of ordinary dishes for her to try. “I’m so excited. This is literally like a new chapter for me,” she said while filming the reality series. “I have healthy relationships with food, healthy relationships with people, I’m learning how to be vulnerable.”</p><p>Scroll down to read about other stars trying ordinary foods for the first time:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyxtcKtrKudo2SwprjEm6pmrKKutq%2BzjJ%2BmqJyjYrOwvoytn55llp6%2FtMCMraCmnV2gxq21xGahnqaemr9uwM6mZJuqkZnGbrnOq5xo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

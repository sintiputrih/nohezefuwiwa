Oh. My. Gawd. It’s Chandler’s birthday! That’s right! The hilariously sarcastic Friends character Chandler Bing’s (Matthew Perry) birthday is April 8. This year, he turns 55 years old, which is truly unbelievable. In our minds, Chandler is still in Westchester with Monica (Courteney Cox) running an advertising agency while his kids, Jack and Erica, are off to college."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Maggie shared, “[Janice] just showed up in her skin the way she was and everybody else just had to adjust. … I love that she was so true to herself. And yeah, I think we could all take a page out of her book and just be our authentic selves in the face of the world.” When in doubt, be like Janice!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Aurora in Season 1, Episode 6, “The One With the Butt”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Chandler meets Aurora (Sofia Milos), a beautiful Israeli woman, and asks her on a date.

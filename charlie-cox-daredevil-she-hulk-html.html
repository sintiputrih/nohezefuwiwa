By Michileen Martin | Published 1 year ago  Some fans have been fuming since day 1 of She-Hulk: Attorney at Law that Charlie Cox’s Daredevil hadn’t already stepped in to take over the show, which may be why Marvel just released the preview clip above of the eponymous hero and Daredevil locking horns."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The clip is from this week’s upcoming episode, and appears to feature a fight over Eugene Patilio, aka Leap Frog.</p><p>Taking place in a parking garage at night, the clip opens with a bright green car speeding up the ramp with someone–Charlie Cox’s Daredevil we soon learn–clinging to the roof. The car is stopped by She-Hulk, who the <a href=#>Man Without Fear</a> tells to “back off.” Before things get too heavy, She-Hulk warns her client, “Eugene, get out of here!”</p><p>We know the “Eugene” Jen refers to is Leap Frog because–well, to be honest the bright green car is a big hint–earlier today <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> previewed another clip from the episode, with She-Hulk meeting with her new client. In the clip, Eugene Patilio (Brandon Stanley) is relating a story of trying to be as much a vigilante as Charlie Cox’s Daredevil and failing miserably.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/she-hulk-leap-frog-900x473.jpg><p>It’s probably more of a commentary on the silliness of Daredevil’s early rogues’ gallery than a hint about future Marvel storylines, but of the D-list supervillains that have already appeared on She-Hulk, Leap Frog is the third with connections to Matt Murdock in the source material. Leap Frog and two of the bad guys on retreat from the last episode–Man-Bull (Nathan Hurd) and El Aguila (Joseph Castillo-Midyett)–are more or less under the umbrella of Charlie Cox’s Daredevil. Though these days in both the comics and in adaptations he usually sticks to his grittier Bullseyes and Elektras.</p><p>One question the clip brings up is whether or not Charlie Cox’s appearance in She-Hulk will be isolated to his role as Daredevil, or if the legal skills of Matt Murdock will also come into play. The show’s legal comedy bent would make it seem natural for Murdock to appear in a legal capacity, and yet usually–not always, but usually–he has been portrayed as a defense attorney.</p><p>It also brings up the question of exactly why Charlie Cox’s Daredevil is bothering with a guy like Leap Frog. Sure, they’ve fought in the comics but the guy on the screen usually wouldn’t waste his time on a moronic superhero wanna-be. It could turn out Patilio is guilty of something a lot more sinister than embarrassing catch phrases.</p><p>The second to last episode of She-Hulk: Attorney at Law will stream on Disney+ early Thursday morning, and it will star Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock aka Daredevil. The season finale will stream next week, and it may very well be the series finale. There’s no word yet on whether or not a Season 2 is to be expected.</p><p>After next week, fans can expect to next see Charlie Cox play Daredevil in the upcoming series Echo, and eventually in his own <a href=#>Disney+</a> show Daredevil: Born Again.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ibmJa%2FrbXEZpqosF2ZrrOxw56toqRdqLWmeceuo6RmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

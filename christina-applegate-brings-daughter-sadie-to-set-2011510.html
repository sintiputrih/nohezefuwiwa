Christina Applegate brought her baby girl Sadie Grace LeNoble to the set of Up All Night on Monday. Sadie, 10 months, is the first child for the 39-year-old and her fiance Martyn LeNoble.
Her favorite part of being a mom so far? &#34;Just being in love,&#34; Applegate told Us Weekly at the premiere of Hall Pass in February. &#34;No offense to anyone that I know and love in my life, but you just really don't know love until you have that baby."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sadie, 10 months, is the first child for the 39-year-old and her fiance<strong> Martyn LeNoble</strong>.</p><p>Her favorite part of being a mom so far? "Just being in love," Applegate told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> at the premiere of Hall Pass in February. "No offense to anyone that I know and love in my life, but you just really don't know love until you have that baby. You don't know. It's a whole 'nother ball game."</p><p>The actress told <strong>Ellen DeGeneres </strong>giving birth to her daughter in January was "profound."&nbsp;</p><p>"I didn't like [the epidural]," she explained. "I didn't like the feeling of numbness… It was really creepy to me. It was too much, so we turned it off and we opted to go all the way. Feeling it all."</p><p>And when her baby daughter finally arrived (weighing 7 lbs., 8 oz.), the breast cancer survivor surprised herself. "I dropped my gown, which I don't do," Applegate revealed. (Applegate underwent a double mastectomy in summer 2008 following her breast cancer diagnosis.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: See more pics of Christina and Sadie from PopSugar</a></p><p>"This part of my body is very private to me," she admitted of revealing her chest in the delivery room. "That's a real private place. A place that I don't have a good relationship with, let's say."</p><p>"But at that moment of pulling [Sadie] out and I just tore that thing off. There's a room full of people that I don't know. Nurses and doctors. And she and I just laid there," Applegate says. "It was the best thing that's every happened to me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacoKKewLW1zZpkmqigobKordOeZJuqmaO0tHnDmqygoKSav26%2FwJ2gnmWkpHq0sdNmaWlpYWp%2BcXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

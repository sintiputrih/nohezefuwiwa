The couple eloped in Las Vegas back in December 1991 when Gere was 42 and the young model was 25. Now, more than 30 years later, Crawford is candidly opening up about the pair's short-lived marriage in the newly-released Apple TV+ docuseries The Super Models, and shared her take on why their relationship ultimately didn't last.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Revealing that she was just 22 when she first met Gere (who was 17 years her senior) Crawford said she began to mold herself to be more like him. “In the beginning of a relationship, when you’re a young woman, you’re like, ‘You like baseball? I like baseball. You’re really into Tibetan Buddhism? I might be into that. I’ll try that,’" she explained. "You know, you’re willing to kind of mold yourself around whoever you are in love with.”<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One interest, however, that Crawford kept during her relationship with Gere was fashion. Reflecting on her first Oscars appearance, the model said, "I got invited to go to the Oscars with Richard. I’m like, ‘Well, I mean, what do models do well? We wear clothes well. I better look good...I better be a freaking supermodel.'”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the award show, Crawford wore a red halter dress from Versace with an extreme plunging neckline. "When I showed up in that red dress, I think it was a little like, 'Wow, fashion is back at the Oscars,'" Cindy quipped.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Crawford later explained how her and Richard's age difference became an issue in the relationship. "I just think your twenties for women is such a time where you’re starting to come into your own and feel your own power and connect to your inner strength," she shared. "And it’s hard to change in a relationship because what one person might have signed up for and then all of a sudden you’re not that anymore."&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, "I think I was more willing at 22 to be like, 'OK, I’ll follow,' and then you start going, 'Well, I don’t want to just follow. I want to lead sometimes and I want to walk side by side sometimes.'"<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following her divorce from Gere, Crawford went on to marry former model Rande Gerber in 1998,&nbsp;and the couple welcomed two children together — daughter, Kaia, and son, Presley. Gere later wed model and actress Carey Lowell, with whom he shares a son named Homer. The pair divorced in 2016 and Gere is now married to publicist Alejandra Silva.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wqKlnbFdmL%2Biw8WoqZ1lop6wqa3RnWSgnaKaeq6t0augmp%2BVYsGpsYysrKmdomK6sLDEpapmnJ%2BYwrSx0aKcrGVnboRzgpBq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

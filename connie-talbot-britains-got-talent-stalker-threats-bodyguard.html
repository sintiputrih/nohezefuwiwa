He'd follow me to school every day, and be with me on the playground. People would climb the trees outside my school to get a photo of a little girl in uniform which is just gross.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Britain’s Got Talent star dies aged 32 - see heartbreaking tributes" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f4c6889bf2ba-screenshot-2024-06-03-at-082038.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Britain’s Got Talent star dies aged 32 - see heartbreaking tributes" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Britain’s Got Talent star dies aged 32 - see heartbreaking tributes</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Everything you need to know about Amanda Holden's private life - from spouse Chris Hughes to children" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c3b35bafdc20-amanda-holden-husband-chris-hughes-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Everything you need to know about Amanda Holden's private life - from spouse Chris Hughes to children" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Everything you need to know about Amanda Holden's private life - from spouse Chris Hughes to children</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=efia9gYHDSy data-wc=42>Connie, who was a runner-up in the competition but went on to have a record deal, she added: “I have two four-year-old nieces now and I would track down any person who had any kind of interest in them at that age.”&nbsp;</p><p id=evvOYUX1ikZd data-wc=46>Connie is still a musician and released her most recent single Growing Pains in 2023.

At it was just, I really just wanted to be on the X Factor and obviously I was too young, so I was like, ‘Yes’ this was the next thing. And It was the first season so there were no expectations for the show whatsoever. It just started as a fun day out. It's given me a career today, which is incredible.

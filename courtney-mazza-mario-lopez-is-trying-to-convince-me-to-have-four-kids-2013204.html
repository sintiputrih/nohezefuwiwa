Recently, the Los Angeles-based Lopez family surprised her with a trip to Disney World. And as any little girl obsessed with princesses would be, Gia was over-the-moon. Even mom and dad soaked up the Disney magic when the family had a private meet-and-greet with Gia’s favorite celebs.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Recalling the special day, Courtney says she was surprised at her daughter’s grown-up behavior when meeting Disney’s leading ladies. “Mario was holding her and she went in and was just like ‘What?! What is going on in here?’ It was such a little adult [moment of her], and we just laughed,” she remembers, adding that Gia loves to chatter away at home. “The way she says things, growing into a little child — it’s just amazing how her mind works and how they learn. She’s just a little spitfire!”</p><p>For much more from Courtney Lopez — including why she says taking time out of each day for herself makes her a better mom — watch the video above now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacp6Wnwa%2Bx2GakmrKqlnqurdGipmakn6Wyu3nIrGStqqmeu6h506hknKeeq7avr8RmpJ5lpKR6qa3VnmSfp6Wneqy1w6xka2hhaH9xgI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

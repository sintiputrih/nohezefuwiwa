</strong>2024-09-06</div><p>Cycling may be the healthy option when it comes to your daily commute.</p><p>But, while it might help you shed pounds and keep your ticker in check, for the girls out there it could be doing all sorts of damage to your lady bits.</p><p>Believe it or not, all that pedaling could be making you bigger down there, increasing your risk of nasty infections and affecting your sex life.</p><p>When you take up cycling you expect your legs to burn and your bum to get a little saddle sore.</p><p>But experts warn the hobby could leave you feeling a “burning sensation” in your vagina.</p><p>Pradnya Pisal, consultant gynecologist at London Gynecology <a href=# rel=noopener>told Metro.co.uk</a> all cyclists – boys and girls alike – will suffer some discomfort in their private regions.</p><p>She said: “For women cyclists, the most common problems are chafing, saddle sores, skin sensitivity and numbness, labial enlargement, vaginal irritation and infection (thrush and bacterial vaginosis), skin infections and urinary tract infections.”</p><p>Any cyclist will know the build up of pressure that comes with a long ride in the saddle.</p><p>And the reason?</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>According to Cycling UK,</a> when a woman sits on a road bike, her vulva – something that is absolutely not designed to be weight bearing – can be required to take as much as 40 percent of her body weight.</p><p>But the consequences could be much more unpleasant than just a twinge of pain.</p><p>Pradnya said pressure on a woman’s vulva can cause the labia to become swollen and appear bigger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

and this can be a problem as the skin problems are likely exacerbated.”</p><p>While it’s likely an avid cyclist might see their lady bits get a little bigger, popping a pair of padded shorts on the shopping list could help reduce the damage in the long-run.</p><p>Phil Burt, head of physiology at British Cycling, has in the past warned female cyclists suffering swollen labia to put their embarrassment to one side and go to the doctor.</p><p>“If you have a seriously swollen labia, it’s quite personal to talk about, but it really needs addressing as soon as possible,” he told Cycling UK.</p><p>Another problem lady cyclists need to be aware of, according to Pradnya is numbness down there.</p><p>In 2006, a <a href=# rel=noopener>study by scientists at Yale University School of Medicine </a>and published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, found that cycling more than 100 miles a week can cause significant reduction in genital sensation.</p><p>And the findings showed a notable increase in pain and numbness, leading to some sexual dysfunction.</p><p>Yes, that’s right – your ability to orgasm could suffer.</p><p>Meanwhile, you could be left with a nasty infection that will put you off sex for good (well, for a bit.)</p><p>Thrush is a common but seriously unpleasant yeast infection that affects most women at some point.</p><p>It can cause an intolerable burning sensation when you pee, pain during sex, soreness and itching.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/170714-cycling-women-sex-lives-embed2.jpg><p>In most cases, it’s an easy one to treat, with help from your pharmacists and over-the-counter medications.</p><p>But, in some cases, it is important you see your gynecologist.</p><p>It can be caused by yeasts building up in the vagina, upsetting the natural bacteria women have down there.</p><p>Another infection that can be caused by bad bacteria is a urinary tract infection, or cystitis.</p><p>The agonizing infection causes pain, burning and stinging when you pee.</p><p>And to top it off you need to pee what feels like all the time.</p><p>If left untreated cystitis can lead to serious kidney infection.</p><p>But, female cyclists… take a breath and be reassured, there are things you can do to minimize the damage.</p><p>The position you ride in is key, with more upright postures better when it comes to avoiding swollen bits.</p><p>And unsurprisingly, the right saddle is important, if you’re planning on hopping on your bike regularly.</p><p>While it might be tempting to listen to your cycling pals, a better bet is to consult the experts at your local bike shop.</p><p>And while you’re at it, throw a pair of padded shorts or three in for good measure.</p><p class=postsid

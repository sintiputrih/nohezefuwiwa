The show builds itself around the constant friction between director, owner, and choreographer of the Abby Lee Dance Company, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Abby Lee Miller</a>, and the mothers of her many talented pupils.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>It’s been several years since the absurdly enthralling series aired its most recent episode, but thanks to its presence on several streaming services — check <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hulu</a> or the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lifetime</a> channel — Dance Moms remains a fan favorite.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>Some of the stars the series has birthed have risen to incredible heights, blossoming into genuine superstars over the course of their still-young careers. Others remained relatively small or else disappeared completely from the limelight. The diverse scope of talent fans have witnessed on the show over eight seasons has likewise led to a broad range of incomes, as some of the show’s most popular stars vastly out-earn their former teammates.</p><h2 id=h-dance-moms-stars-net-worth data-injectable=false><strong>Dance Moms stars’ net worth</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true>Even the lowest-earning former Dance Moms star is living comfortably off the money they earned both on the show and off, with several enjoying celebrated careers in music, dance, and acting. The most popular of the show’s former stars have greatly surpassed their former mentor, Abby Lee Miller, while others are more content with a low-key life away from the spotlight.</p><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>A few of the more recent, or less frequent Dance Moms stars, have yet to earn a proper documentation of their net worths. While we aren’t purposefully excluding fresher stars, like the season eight lineup, we also don’t think a range of $100,000 to $1 million really counts. If we ever know more about the wealth they’ve accumulated on and off the show, stars like Pressley Hosbach and GiaNina Paolantonio will be added to this list, but in the meantime, we’re sticking to better-established staples.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>13. Brynn Rumfallo – $200,000</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by brynn (@brynnrumfallo)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=844 data-injectable=true>Brynn Rumfallo almost falls into the camp noted above, with a hazy net worth estimated between $200,000 and $300,000 noted in most publications. Her presence across several seasons of Dance Moms, along with her work on America’s Got Talent and later modeling, earns her a spot on this list. Rumfallo only stayed on Dance Moms for a few seasons, but she and Abby are still closely tied — as her modeling for brands like Abby Lee Apparel makes clear — and she’s largely got the titular Dance Moms to thank for her current wealth.</p><h2 id=h-12-brooke-hyland-500-000 data-injectable=false><strong>12. Brooke Hyland – $500,000</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by BROOKE HYLAND (@brookehyland)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=555 data-current-count=855 data-injectable=true>One of the first of Dance Moms’ original stars to say goodbye to the show has since maintained a relatively low-key life. While she has released several musical tracks and acted in a film or two in the years following her departure, it seems that Brooke mostly plans to carve out a new direction in life for herself. She has since graduated from Ohio University and pivoted into a career in fashion and e-commerce, according to a 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A-List Nation</a>, and already has a tidy $500,000 net worth in her early 20s, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Things</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>11. Gianna Martello – $600,000</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gianna Martello (@giannamartello)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=776 data-current-count=1076 data-injectable=true>She’s no Abby Lee Miller, but Dance Moms‘ second choreographer and dance instructor, Gianna Martello, is still a vital staple of the show. The fact that she sports far less screen time than Miller and the dancers themselves are probably to blame for Martello’s slightly lower net worth. At around $600,000 according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, she’s still earned a tidy amount over the years. Most of Martello’s accumulated cash comes from Dance Moms and her work with the Abby Lee Dance Company. She’s also earned some money from alternate projects, like when she directed the music video for “Cry” by Alexx Calise and her recent work in online dance classes, which allow her to maintain a solid living through the work she loves.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>10. Vivi-Anne Stein – $1 million</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Cathy Nesbitt-Stein (@cathynesbittsteinofficial)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=598 data-current-count=898 data-injectable=true>Ah, Vivi-Anne. The child of Abby’s officially declared nemesis, Cathy Stein of Candy Apples Dance Center, Vivi was a prominent element of Dance Moms during the show’s first season. Later seasons saw she and her mom pop up plenty, as the rivalry between Cathy and Abby continued to inject constant drama into the show, but Vivi was often relegated to the background. We assume this was a choice Vivi made herself, considering how often she seemed disinclined to be part of the ongoing drama, so we’re perfectly content with those rare Vivi sightings between seasons two and seven.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Vivi’s overall net worth isn’t concretely confirmed, but it appears to be edging toward the $1 million mark, according to various reports. She might even be worth as much as $1.5 million, but we’ll keep the estimate on the lower end, since a bulk of her income comes from her family’s success, paired with Vivi’s own talent.</p><h2 id=h-9-abby-lee-miller-1-million data-injectable=false><strong>9.

Miller’s net worth used to be much higher, thanks to sky-high tuition costs and a steady income from the series, but legal issues and a stint in prison drastically drained the Dance Moms star’s bank account. She was worth a still-impressive $2 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, a few years back, but that number has since dropped to around $1 million.</p><h2 id=h-8-kendall-vertes-1-5-million data-injectable=false><strong>8.

Kendall Vertes, who debuted in the show’s second season, has maintained star status in the years following her departure from the series. She’s since signed onto several film and television projects and released a few music videos, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one single</a> topping 28 million views on YouTube.

She, like Miller, the younger Hyland, and Hilliker, has a net worth of $2 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MDDailyRecord</a>.

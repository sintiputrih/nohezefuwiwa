The series, which first <strong>began in 2003, officially ended in 2015 after 12 successful seasons</strong>. While most folks tuned in for the over-the-top funny rapport between on-screen brothers, Charlie and Alan, things took a major turn in 2011. <a href=#>Charlie Sheen was fired from the show</a> after exhibiting <strong>"dangerously self-destructive conduct"</strong>, which completely shifted the overall environment behind the scenes.</p><p>Although fans didn't know what producers would do with the show moving forward, they managed to find a solution and <a href=#>brought on Ashton Kutcher</a> to complete the final four seasons.</p><p>Since the show's conclussion, Jon Cryer has come forward to talk about his time on the show with Charlie and whether the two ever really got along or put on an act for the cameras.

This happened when he was asked if he would work with Sheen again, to which Cryer said that he did not know if he wanted to "get in business with [Sheen] for any length of time."

The duo played on-screen brothers, Alan and Charlie Harper, who hilariously lived very different lives all under the same roof. <a href=#>Fans adored the duo</a> and, of course, Cryer's TV son, Angus T. Jones, making for what was one of the best sitcoms in television history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During this period, Charlie Sheen underwent his divorce from actress Denise Richards and began to turn to drugs and alcohol again. This ultimately led Sheen down a dark path and left the show's executives with no other choice but to officially let him go.</p><p>After eight seasons, Charlie Sheen was no longer part of the production and was written out, allowing for Ashton Kutcher's character to flawlessly make his entrance.

We had a great first few years on that show," he said. "It was incredibly smooth, we had a lovely time, it was working really well." Cryer finished.</p><p>While Jon believes that things did take a turn when Charlie resorted to drugs and alcohol, he said that he remained kind and friendly to everyone in the cast and crew. Despite remaining professional, Jon says that things began to wear Charlie down and the time in between Sheen's firing and getting a replacement was "crazy" and an absolute "sh-t storm".</p><p>Although many thought Charlie and Jon had their differences, the duo were, in fact, the best of friends!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:01</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/your-paragraph-text-2023-12-17t122844-573.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jon Cryer Was Forced To Pay Thousands In Child Support Despite Getting Custody Of His Child</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jon Cryer's divorce with Sarah Trigger took many disturbing twists and turns.</span><h2 id=jon-cryer-does-not-have-any-plans-to-work-with-charlie-sheen-in-the-future>Jon Cryer Does Not Have Any Plans To Work With Charlie Sheen In The Future</h2><h3 id=jon-cryer-is-hesitant-to-work-with-charlie-sheen-in-the-future>Jon Cryer is hesitant to work with Charlie Sheen in the future</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jon-cryer-smiling.jpg><p>Even though Jon and Charlie had great on-screen chemistry with one another and fans would love to see them team up for another project, Jon has his reservations about working with Charlie again. This, despite knowing that Charlie is seemingly doing better than he was over a decade ago.</p><p>"Charlie is doing a lot better now, which is wonderful," Jon explained. "He and I have not spoken in a few years, but he's doing a lot better, which obviously I'm very happy about."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jon went on to say, "When Two and a Half Men was happening, Charlie was like, the highest-paid actor in television," Cryer continued. "Yet, he blew it up, so you kind of have to think. I love him, I wish him the best, he should live in good health for the rest of his life, but I don’t know if I want to get in business with him for any length of time."</p><p>It appears that <a href=#>Jon has learned his lesson about working with Charlie</a>. While it would be fun to do it again, not knowing if the behavior could change is something Jon would prefer to not have to worry about when working.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmLWivsuinGarmJqyr3nAp5tmop%2BjeqS%2B2J6pZp%2BVqXqiuM6nnmannmLBuLuMmqWdZZFitaK4xWaknqZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

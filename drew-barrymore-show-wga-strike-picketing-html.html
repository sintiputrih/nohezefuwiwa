A spokesperson for the WGA confirmed to Vulture that anyone providing writing services for The Drew Barrymore Show is in violation of strike rules. According to the spokesperson, the WGA will be monitoring the show, which is due to start airing its fourth season on CBS on September 18.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clme091xy000g3b805pkhmon6@published data-word-count=147>Barrymore said in her statement that her show, which launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, was built for “sensitive times.” “I want to be there to provide what writers do so well, which is a way to bring us together or help us make sense of the human experience,” she said. “I hope for a resolve for everyone as soon as possible. We have navigated difficult times since we first came on air. And so I take a step forward to start season 4 once again with an astute humility.” Barrymore also explained that she stepped back from the MTV Movie & TV Awards in May because she was the host and the ceremony “had a direct conflict with what the strike was dealing with which was studios, streamers, film, and television.” It was also the first week of the strike, she noted.

This news comes a few months after Barrymore decided to <a href=#>back out of the MTV Movie & TV Awards</a> in May, explaining at the time, “I have listened to the writers, and in order to truly respect them, I will pivot from hosting the MTV Movie & TV Awards live in solidarity with the strike.” Barrymore’s reps did not immediately respond to Vulture’s request for comment, but a CBS spokesperson suggested <a href=#>to Vanity Fair</a> that the upcoming new episodes don’t make Barrymore a hypocrite. According to the spokesperson, the show “will not be performing any writing work covered by the WGA strike.” The WGA, however, does not agree. WGA spokesperson Jason Gordon told Vanity Fair that the production is a “WGA-covered struck television show. It has stayed off the air since the strike began on May 2nd, but has now (unfortunately) decided to return without its writers.” As a result, there will be picketing. We wonder if this’ll make any headlines over at <a href=#>“Drew’s News.”</a></p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Cracked</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Vanity Fair</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clg439xxh00000idk971cy3ky@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The 2023 Hollywood Strike for Dummies</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clf9qzu5n00000ie1aw5p9kap@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Drew Barrymore Backs Out of MTV Movie & TV Awards Over Writers’ Strike</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clieqr7m900000ij52elyhod9@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Drew Barrymore Is Figuring It Out Live</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cllmj8r1d00000pdgjilkm7b9@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Reneé Rapp Will Go to War for Drew Barrymore If Necessary</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Drew Barrymore Show Apparently Returning Without WGA Writers</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdgbnylvsSwZJuZoqfGrrvRnmSsoJ%2BserizwGaqraqZoLJuvMicop6smaO0b7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

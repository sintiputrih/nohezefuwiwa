Following the shocking season 17 premiere of Grey’s Anatomy, star and producer Ellen Pompeo appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! to break down Patrick Dempsey‘s return.

“This is a hypothetical [question], of course. Let’s say that since he left the show, Patrick had put on, like, 80 pounds. He was really fat,” host Jimmy Kimmel asked Pompeo, 51, during the Thursday, November 12, episode."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Would it be like, he’s like, ‘Hey, here I am on the beach!

It wouldn’t have the same impact with the fans. You know, the girls want to see McDreamy being McDreamy.”</p><p>At the end of Thursday’s episode, <a href=#>Dempsey, 54, returned to the show</a> for the first time in five years. The <a href=#>character of Derek Shepherd died in a car crash</a> at the end of season 11, leaving Meredith absolutely shattered.</p><p>During the premiere, Meredith was found unconscious in the Grey Sloan parking lot. When she wouldn’t wake up, the cameras cut to a gorgeous beach, where she reunited <a href=#>with her late husband</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fans will see more of Derek in upcoming episodes, showrunner <strong>Krista Vernoff</strong> revealed to <a href=#>Deadline</a> after the episode. Vernoff, as well as Dempsey and Pompeo, also explained that they wanted to bring back the character now — in 2020 — to give fans a reason to smile after such a difficult year.</p><p>“I really love the message of what the dynamic is in this story. With everything that we’re dealing with right now — and certainly, we have been distracted with the election — but we’re going to get back into the reality of COVID and being in a pandemic, and all the lives that have been lost,” the Devils actor said. “Where are these souls going? And I think that’s what attracted me to this story line, I think it can be really helpful and healing to so many people.”</p><p>Grey’s Anatomy airs on ABC Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJylpJWjerG7zKmcqGWfo3qxrdOroJyjXZmyrrzSnrCsZaKawba%2BzWarqGWXp7K6v4yapZqsn6LGbsLInZyoZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Born to Noah and Mary Royston Keaton, she spent her life in Sneedville, leaving an indelible mark on the community and her loved ones. Evelyn’s life was deeply intertwined with her faith, a cornerstone that guided her journey from an early age. She professed her faith and was saved at a young age, a pivotal moment that set the course for the rest of her life. Her commitment to her spirituality led her to become a cherished member of Swan Creek Primitive Baptist Church, where she remained a faithful congregant throughout her entire life.</p><p>In her union with Elder Tyler James (T.J.) Elliott, Evelyn found a partner with whom she shared the joys and challenges of life. T.J.’s passing preceded hers, leaving a void that Evelyn carried with grace and resilience. In addition to her husband, she was preceded in death by her parents, Noah and Mary Royston Keaton, her brother Hairm Keaton, and one great-grandchild.</p><p>Evelyn’s presence in Swan Creek Primitive Baptist Church was characterized by her infectious joy and warm spirit. The church community, deeply touched by her kindness, will forever hold onto memories of her cheerful smile and the affectionate hugs she shared during moments of fellowship. Her expressions of joy in the Lord, evident in the uplifting gesture of raising her hands above her head and clapping them in praise, stood as a testament to the profound connection she felt with her faith.</p><p>As Evelyn Elliott departs from this world, her legacy of faith, love, and joy will undoubtedly endure in the hearts of those who had the privilege of knowing her. The community mourns the loss of a cherished member and celebrates the life of a woman who lived with unwavering devotion to her faith and community.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwsdWeo7KmXZq5rbXOratmp5Kewbat0bJknq6VocavecSlo6KnpGK1or%2BMrJidpKlivaK%2F0p6bZpmnlsZustSnnKuZnGKxpsDAoqOsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

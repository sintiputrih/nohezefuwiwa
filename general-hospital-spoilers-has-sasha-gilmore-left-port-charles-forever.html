She came to town to trick Nina Reeves (Cynthia Watros) into believing she was her presumed dead daughter.</p><h3>Maybe The Past Five Years Have Been Karmic Payback?</h3><p>Sasha eventually straightened her life out only to have it kink up multiple times. She and her husband Brando Corbin (Johnny Wactor) got married while she was high as a kite, addicted to pills, but eventually worked through her deception and addiction.</p><p><a href=#>Later she became pregnant but tragically they lost their baby</a>, Liam. Next Brando was murdered, and all of this loss sent Sasha into another drug-fueled spiral.</p><p>Long story short, Sasha seemed to be getting her life together finally.

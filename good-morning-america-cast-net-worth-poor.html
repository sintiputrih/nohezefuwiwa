The show has been on the air <strong>since November 1975</strong>, starting off with being on weekdays only before bringing in the weekend airings in 1993.</p><p>While some <a href=#>cast members would be considered the richest Good Morning America host</a>, others have not been so lucky and are in fact, rather poor considering being on the morning show. For example, <a href=#>since leaving his former talk show, Live! With Kelly And Michael</a>, Michael Strahan has become the richest cast member on the show with a net worth of $65 million and a salary of approximately $17 million.</p><p>Robin Roberts and George Stephanopoulos are also considered to be quite rich.

However, over the last several years, 'Good Morning America' has taken the top spot. Something that they continued to do into the first part of 2024. The latest stats show that 'GMA' has an average of 77,000 viewers more than 'Today'. The better the show, the more money there is to be distributed to the talent, of course. As such, it would not be surprising for the cast of 'Good Morning America' to have their net worths grow if this trend continues.</p><h2 id=ginger-zee><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ginger Zee</span></h2><h3 id=net-worth-2-5-million>Net Worth: $2.5 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/untitled-design-4-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Zee's salary is $500,000</strong></li></ul><p>First up on the list is Ginger Zee.

A flick through his Twitter timeline over the last few weeks will see videos criticizing the police and retweets of progressive politicians like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Beyond that, there’s a litany of venom directed at President Donald Trump, with Bautista <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not mincing words when it comes to the Commander-in-Chief</a>:</p><p>“Try picturing President Dumb-Dumb tweeting this naked (great big mushy butt and that big sloppy gut hanging over his tiny little mushroom)eating a ham&cheese sandwich(crumbs on his man boobs)trying to figure out how to spell Pocahontas Face with tears of joy. I.e. he’s pathetic,” tweeted the actor.</p><p data-characters=37 data-current-count=37 data-injectable=false>What a lovely image. Thanks for that.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Bautista is notoriously outspoken whenever he feels like an injustice is committed. In fact, he can get so passionate that many assumed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his fierce criticism of Disney when they temporarily fired James Gunn</a> (who clapped his new tattoo) from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</a>&nbsp;would prevent him from ever working with the studio again. That obviously didn’t happen, though.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false><strong>Dave Bautista</strong> will no doubt be preparing to return as Drax, but we don’t know when the next Guardians film is set to shoot. In the meantime, his latest effort, My Spy, is landing on Amazon Prime on June 26th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonq6Zopm2orrSZp6apJGtxm6%2F05qpZpyRq7JursCuq6KrpJZ6ta3TraaoZaOdvLh50q6nqaeiqXqjuMxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

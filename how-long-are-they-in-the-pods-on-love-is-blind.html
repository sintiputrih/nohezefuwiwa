Source: NetflixDating shows are generally fun to watch, and Love Is Blind has certainly snagged the attention of reality TV lovers over the last couple of years. The hit Netflix series is a lot different from other dating shows since the individuals looking for love aren’t technically allowed to lay eyes on each other during the dating process."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Here's the truth about the time frame as hopeful singles attempt to find true love.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Dating shows are generally fun to watch, and <a href=#>Love Is Blind</a> has certainly snagged the attention of reality TV lovers over the last couple of years. The hit <a href=#>Netflix</a> series is a lot different from other dating shows since the individuals looking for love aren’t technically allowed to lay eyes on each other during the dating process.</p><p>They first have to spend time sitting in "pods," talking to each other through a wall and getting to know each other based on personalities, senses of humor, and memorable anecdotes.</p><p>But how long do the people on the show stay in the pods? Distractify spoke exclusively with Season 2 cast member <a href=#>Kyle Abrams</a> about what it was like to get to know someone through a wall.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Season 2 cast member Kyle Abrams.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How long are they in the pods on 'Love is Blind'?</h2><p>The pods used in Love Is Blind are a series of small-sized rooms decorated with rugs, couches, and a shiny blue wall separating the men's pods from women's. The contestants can hear each other's voices through the wall, but they can't see each other's faces or bodies. The purpose of the show is to test the idea that true love is genuinely blind.</p><p>According to Kyle, the time spent in the pods varied for Season 2, but it did increase as the season progressed and as he and other cast members made connections.</p><p>He explained to us that the dates in the pods "started out like speed dating" and those turned into two-to-three hour dates.</p><p>But they grew even longer from there.</p><p>"I think eventually the last ones were like four hours," Kyle shared. "And so it was daunting, like having to talk for four hours straight without even looking at the person is amazing."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>If love is indeed blind, falling in love with someone based on their personality alone should be enough … right? This show has proven that it’s <a href=#>possible for couples to fall in love</a> inside the pods without ever laying eyes on each other, but this fairy-tale ending <a href=#>doesn’t always work out</a> as perfectly as hopeful singles might wish.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here’s what else you should know about the 'Love Is Blind' pods.</h2><p>Along with the fact that contestants are only allowed to spend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 days in the pods</a> getting to know their potential future spouse, there are a few other interesting details to learn. The pods are about 12 feet by 12 feet, which means they’re not too small but they’re not too spacious either. Twenty pods were built to give contestants a chance at falling in love, with 10 of them designed for men and 10 designed for women.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>In Season 1 of the show, contestants slept in cots inside trailers next to the lounges. For Season 2, the contestants were placed in hotel rooms so they'd feel more comfortable.</p><p>Another fun fact is that the pods remain stocked up with an assortment of beverages (both alcoholic and nonalcoholic) at all hours of the day and night.</p><p>The entirety of Seasons 1 and 2 of Love is Blind are available for streaming on Netflix now — and Season 3 kicked off on Oct. 19, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecuopaBlkaeybsDHnrBmoZ5iwamxjKmmnatdpLtuuM6vnGaho2KvrbXNnQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

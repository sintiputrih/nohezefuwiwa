However, if you’re not entirely aware of what that might be, I’ve got your back. Without any further ado, here’s the best watch order for The Librarian.</p><h2 id=h-the-best-the-librarian-watch-order data-injectable=false>The best The Librarian watch order</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>As I previously mentioned, the best way to watch The Librarian saga is by ultimately following its order of release on the big screen. Although the story itself might prove convoluted with intricate plotlines and loose ends, the order itself is quite straightforward, allowing fans to watch the story without needing to look into any <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">needlessly complicated watch orders</a>. On that note, this is the watch order for the films:</p><ul data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false><li>The Librarian: Quest for the Spear (2004)</li><li>The Librarian: Return to King Solomon’s Mines (2006)</li><li>The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice (2008)</li></ul><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>However, there is a small detail that you might want to take into consideration after setting foot in the story. This trilogy is actually complemented by a renowned television series starring Noah Wyle.</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>The series titled <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Librarians</a> expands upon the existing mythology of the films, masterfully complementing the story from its installments on the big screen. Aside from its plot, the series also retained some of the core cast members and introduced new characters.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>Spanning four seasons, it provides a compelling conclusion to this franchise and may be the ideal way to bring the story to its final resolution. The series premiered in 2014 and serves as the missing piece that completes the mystery puzzle, proving to be the perfect last addition to the list for everyone hoping to finally finish off this franchise.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>As for where to watch all of the aforementioned films, you might want to head to Peacock or FuboTV, depending on your preference. As for the series, it is available to watch on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXam8bsPArZqhZZGhuW7Ax55kpaGSp66ztcCnZKanpp6ytHnIp2SoqpSav3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

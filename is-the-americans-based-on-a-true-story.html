Yes and no …</h2><p>You can’t believe everything that you see on TV, but when it comes to FX’s The Americans, art certainly imitates life. Although The Americans isn’t totally based on a true story, it is inspired by one.</p><p>History buffs might notice that Elizabeth and Philip’s story sounds eerily similar to that of Tracey Lee Ann Foley and Donald Howard Heathfield (born <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elena Vavilova and Andrey Bezrukov</a>), Russian spies who were arrested along with eight other sleeper agents by the FBI in 2010.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Elena Vavilova and Andrey Bezrukov?

Nonetheless, the twists and turns persisted as he confronted a new set of problems.&nbsp;Despite being released at the final roster cuts on September 5, 2020, Browning was re-signed to the Vikings’ practice squad the next day.&nbsp;Browning signed a reserve/future deal with the Vikings on January 4, 2021, to continue the tale.&nbsp;However, the NFL’s unpredictable nature ran its course, and Browning faced yet another release on August 31, 2021.</p><h2>Cincinnati Bengals</h2><p><strong>Jake Browning</strong> began a new chapter in his NFL career on September 7, 2021, when he was signed to the Cincinnati Bengals’ practice squad—a hopeful move for the motivated quarterback.&nbsp;Browning capitalized on this momentum by further strengthening his relationship with the Bengals.&nbsp;He made a crucial step forward on February 15, 2022, when he signed a reserve/future contract, demonstrating his devotion and the team’s conviction in his potential.</p><p>Browning, however, suffered a minor setback when he was released on August 30, 2022, only to quickly reappear on the practice squad the next day.&nbsp;Browning’s voyage proceeded, unaffected by the difficulties.

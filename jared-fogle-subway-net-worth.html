He is a well-known spokesman and television personality, perhaps best known for incredible weight loss and for advertising the “Subway” restaurants. Now Fogle is involved in a scandal related to child pornography, and this has made his name regularly mentioned in the media.

In 1999 Jared’s name became known to the media as his story about a significant weight loss was published in the newspaper, “Indiana Daily Student”. Later his story also appeared in “Men’s Health”, and this added a lot to his net worth. The story was mainly about how Jared was able to lose a lot of weight by eating “Subway” sandwiches, so there is no surprise that soon the “Subway” restaurants became interested in Fogle and his story.

Soon he started appearing in more commercials and even travelled around the United States representing “Subway” restaurants.</p><p>As Jared became more and more famous he decided to create his own foundation, called “The Jared Foundation”, which helped to fight childhood obesity.

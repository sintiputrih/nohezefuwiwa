Jared Goff has a sister called Lauren Goff. She attended the University of California at Berkeley. Goff was an avid participant in baseball, football, and soccer starting at a young age. But it wasn’t until he entered Marin Catholic High School in Kentfield, California, that he started concentrating solely on the American pastime.</p><p>Jared Goff played three seasons of varsity football for his high school, completing 477 of 767 passes for a 62.2% completion rate and 7,687 yards.

The following year, despite the team’s appalling 1-11 record, he started all twelve of his team’s games and set single-season school records in a number of categories, including yards, yardage gains, completed passes, and pass attempts.</p><p>Jared Goff continued to develop as a player in his second season, setting yet another school record and contributing to his team’s better record of 5-7.

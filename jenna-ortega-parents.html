"They sacrificed a lot so that I could do what I do. Another thing I love about them is that they don’t care at all about what I do."</p><p>She continued, "They have no interest whatsoever in this world or in the film industry. I could come home from work with cool people, prominent people, people I looked up to, and they weren’t interested. They were like, ‘hey, you didn’t do the dishes before you left, so you’re going to have to do them all week.'"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jenna was raised bilingual — and has been very vocal about her Latin upbringing.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Jenna's mother is of Puerto Rican and Mexican descent while her father is Mexican American.

"My mom is bilingual because her grandmother babysat her often and taught her Spanish. The plan was for her to speak it to us and for my father to speak English so that we could learn both languages."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She went on to explain that her family has done their best to keep the most important traditions alive over the years, including piñatas during birthday celebrations and freshly made tamales at Christmas time.</p><p>Jenna was also vocal about the fact that her ethnicity sometimes slowed her down in the entertainment industry.</p><p>"As a Latina, there are not as many roles out there for me," she explained. "When I first started out, it was hard. I was constantly shut down because I did not have the look they were going for.

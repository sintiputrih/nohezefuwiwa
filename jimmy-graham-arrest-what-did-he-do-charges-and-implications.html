This category includes a broad range of substances, from illegal narcotics like cocaine to prescribed pharmaceuticals. The issue is, what drug was in Graham’s system, and did he have a valid cause to take it?</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jimmy-Graham-1.jpg alt="Jimmy Graham" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span id=the-medical-episode-more-than-meets-the-eye>The Medical Episode: More Than Meets the Eye</span></h2><p>The specifics of Graham’s medical crisis are unknown.

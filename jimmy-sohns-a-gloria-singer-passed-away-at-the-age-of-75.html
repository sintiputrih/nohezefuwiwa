The band became well-known for their song Gloria.&nbsp;Jimmy’s daughter said that her father passed away on July 29, 2022. According to the band, Sohns was in the hospital after having a stroke. Sohns used to exchange old images of the band with his pal on the band’s social media profile, which is still live.</p><h2>Everything about Jimmy Sohns and The Shadows of Knight</h2><p>Jimmy Sohns rose to prominence as a member of the rock band The Shadows of Knight. There is presently no detailed information accessible about his personal life.&nbsp;The Shadows of Knight were created in 1964 as Shadows, which was eventually altered to The Shadows of Knight. During their tenure, they published five albums. Warren Rogers, Roger Spielmann, Norm Gotsch, Wayne Pursell, Tom Schiffour, and Jimmy Sohns were among the first members.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jimmy-Sohns-2.jpg alt="Jimmy Sohns" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Between 1964 and 1965, the band played in Chicago’s northwest suburbs and became the house band at The Cellar, an Illinois music venue. Around 500 youths attended their gigs, and a tape of their act was published in 1992. Their song Gloria, which was published in 1965, catapulted them to popularity.&nbsp;The trio then issued an album called Gloria, followed by Back Door Men in 1966. Their singles, however, were not as well-received as Gloria’s, and the band gradually faded. Several members quit the band, including Tom Schiffour and Bruce Bruscato.</p><p>By 1967, Jimmy Sohns was the only surviving member, and he obtained the sole proprietor of the band’s name. The band was soon contracted to Buddah Records, and their second song, Shake, was released in 1969. Throughout the 1970s, the band continued to perform in clubs with a slew of new members. The band was joined by John Fisher, Glass Menagerie, Woody Woodruff, Dan Baughman, and Ken Turkin.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jimmy-Sohns-3.jpg alt="Jimmy Sohns" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Over the following several years, the remaining members of the band were replaced. From 1978 through 1990, Sohns was the road manager for Skafish. Sundazed Records subsequently reissued the band’s records in remastered form. They have played on a variety of occasions and were joined by Rick Mullen on their 2006 tour. In 2008, the band played as part of The Psychedelic Shack Tour, with Nazz, Vince Martell, and Henry Gross. They went on to play in a concert in August 2016.</p><h2>Twitter users pay tribute</h2><p>Jimmy Sohns was a well-known figure in the music business.

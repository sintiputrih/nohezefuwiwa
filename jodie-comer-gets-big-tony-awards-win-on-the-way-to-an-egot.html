Although she started out on the British series My Mad Fat Diary and BBC drama Doctor Foster, it was her role in Killing Eve that really made people sit up and pay attention. Now, the actress is teetering on the precipice of earning the status of EGOT.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>EGOT is the acronym used for those who have managed to achieve this extremely difficult feet: winning an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony. As it currently stands there are only 18 EGOT winners, including Viola Davis, Jennifer Hudson, Mel Brooks, John Legend, and Andrew Loyd Webber. Comer is now halfway to collecting the title, having just secured her second of the four awards necessary.</p><p data-characters=628 data-current-count=1022 data-injectable=true>Comer has added a Tony award to her list, having won the category for Best Actress for her role in the one-woman play Prima Facie. The role was an exhausting one, as she played a lawyer who defends men who have been accused of sexual assault only to then find herself on the other side as a rape victim. This is a tricky and emotionally draining role to take on by anyone‚Äôs standard, with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a> saying, it was ‚Äúa performance of tremendous skill and improbable stamina.‚Äù She was up against the likes of Jessica Chastain, who performed in Henrik Ibsen‚Äôs well-known play A Doll‚Äôs House.</p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>What makes this award even more impressive is that this wasn‚Äôt just her first Tony nomination, but her first professional stage play ever. Though that makes it feel even more astounding, having seen <a href=#>Comer‚Äôs catalogue of work</a> onscreen, we can‚Äôt say we are that surprised. From her role as the crazed Villanelle in Killing Eve ‚Äì which won her an Emmy ‚Äì to her part in Help (which nabbed her a BFTA), she has consistently blown us away.</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>Fans are praising the actress online and commenting that how at only 30 years of age, the actress is now halfway to EGOT status.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>an emmy, two baftas, a golden globe nom, an olivier plus many many theatre awards and today.. tony award winner for the same performance.. at 30 years old being halfway to egot status, jodie comer IS indeed the actress of our generation <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wCXy0Dwtu9</a></p>‚Äî lilsü™ê DWOHT STILL SAFE (@flavvialy) <a href=#>June 12, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=false>The Tony was not the only award she managed to gain from her first-ever professional stage performance. The actress also recently took home the Lawrence Olivier Award for Prima Facie as well. Her next role will see her in the movie adaption of the book, The End We Start From, which follows a young mother and her baby trying to escape London after it is hit by a flood. The film also stars such names as Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, and Katherine Waterstone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3sLDInmScp52av26zxK2qZpqZnHq1u82yZJqvkaextHnWoqVmp55iwamxjLCYsmWkpHqiuoyenqisXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

The actor’s weight-loss journey first began in 2011 but resumed in 2017 after he worked hard tolose the 40 lbs he gained for his 2015 role in War Dogs. To do so, he enlisted the help of a nutritionist and trainer and even got advice from some trim and toned friends, including his 21 Jump Street costar Channing Tatum."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

To do so, he enlisted the help of a nutritionist and trainer and even got advice from some trim and toned friends, including his 21 Jump Street costar <a href=#><strong>Channing Tatum</strong></a>.</p><p>“I gained weight for this movie War Dogs, and then I wanted to get in better shape, so I called Channing Tatum and said, ‘Hey, if I ate less and go to a trainer, will I get in better shape?’” Hill recalled on <a href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> in August 2016. “And [Tatum] said, ‘Yes, you dumb motherf–ker, of course, you will. It’s the simplest thing in the entire world.’”</p><p>The Superbad star got real in October 2018 about <a href=#>struggling with his weight</a>.</p><p>“I think everybody has a version of themselves — I call it, like, a snapshot, let’s say, at some point in your life, of the person you are,” he explained on <a href=#>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> at the time. “You’re trying to kind of hide from the world or [it] makes you feel a certain way, and even if you get success or you grow up or you become good-looking or whatever, the things that you think will fix the thing, you kind of carry some part of that with you. So, for me, it’s definitely being, like, this 14-year-old kid, being overweight, wanting to fit in with these skaters and hip-hop kids and just feeling lonely and maybe not understanding my own worth.”</p><p>Hill noted that he later began to “understand how much [it] hurt” to be called “fat and gross and unattractive” early in his career. “I’m under construction like we all are, you know what I mean? We’re all just trying to figure it out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Moneyball actor subsequently shared a body-positive message with his fans in February 2021 after shirtless photos of him surfaced online.</p><p>“I don’t think I ever took my shirt off in a pool until I was in my mid 30s even in front of family and friends. Probably would have <a href=#>happened sooner if my childhood insecurities weren’t exacerbated</a> by years of public mockery about my body by press and interviewers,” he wrote via Instagram. “So the idea that the media tries to play me by stalking me while surfing and printing photos like this and it can’t phase [sic] me anymore is dope. I’m 37 and finally love and accept myself. This isn’t a ‘good for me’ post. And it’s definitely not a ‘feel bad for me post.’ It’s for the kids who don’t take their shirt off at the pool. Have fun. You’re wonderful and awesome and perfect. All my love.”</p><p>Scroll through the pics of the Wolf of Wall Street star to see his body transformation through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkt7C6wKFkoaGcoXq0tM6wqmanlpt6uLHIoJ%2BtZZykwLR5wZ6dqKqVYq6vsIyana2domK9qq%2FTrqmeq12sgXmDkWpuaKKlocZufo9qbmZqXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

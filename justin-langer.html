He played for the Australian National Cricket Team from 1993 to 2007 and is a former cricket coach and player from Australia. From March 5, 2018, until April 2, 2022, he also served as the Australian Men’s National Cricket Team’s coach.</p><p>He was born to Colin Langer, a car salesman, and Joy-Anne Langer, a nurse. In July 2017, his mother passed away at the age of 68. He has two brothers, Jonathan Langer, and Adam Langer, as well as a sister called Jemma. He wed Sue on April 13, 1996. The couple was blessed with four daughters: Ali-Rose, Grace, Jessica, and Sophie. His uncle is the late Australian cricketer Robert Samuel Langer (Rob Langer).</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Justin-Langer-1-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Justin Langer Height, Weight</h2><p><span>He is 6 feet 4 inches tall. He weighs approximately 92 kg. He has lovely warm blue eyes and brown locks. There is no information on his chest-waist-hip measurements, dress size, shoe size, biceps, and so on.</span></p><h2>Career</h2><ul><li>Justin Langer was another example of the battle-tested cricketers with a mental toughness that Western Australia is famed for producing. He was naturally a fighter, but his approach to batting was quite un-Australian. While most of them were unapologetically playing their strokes, Langer opted to stick it to the bowlers, making them bowl spell after spell as he meticulously planned his innings.</li><li>Langer went on to forge one of the greatest opening combinations in the history of the game with the enormous Matthew Hayden. He is the only Australian opener like him, and that statement is true both before and after his playing career.</li><li>Since his debut in the early 1990s, Langer has amassed a ton of runs in the Sheffield Shield, and in 1993, he was appropriately rewarded with a Test cap. The southpaw’s early years were difficult as he fluctuated between the opening position and no. 3 depending on the performance or fitness of other team members.</li><li>As a consequence, his performances varied as well, but things began to turn around for him after Steve Waugh was named team captain. Waugh had a great deal of faith in Langer’s abilities, and from the 1998–1999 season ahead, the opener began to turn things around. However, Langer didn’t begin to reach his full potential until Matthew Hayden was brought in as the opening partner.</li><li>Langer never looked back after that, accumulating runs steadily throughout the years, including an astounding 1400-plus runs in 2004 when he was at the top of his game. In addition to being productive, Langer also improved his intent as a batter. Being well-known for his cuts and pulls, he didn’t think twice about taking an aggressive stance.</li><li>This was maybe the result of having a partner like Hayden, whose optimism influenced his partner. Because Langer’s performance never truly faltered, experts predicted that he may continue playing into his late 30s. But it was not to be as he began to suffer from ailments, particularly rib and hamstring pain.</li><li>In 2005, when Langer was fighting his body, a bouncer from Makhaya Ntini slammed into him, cutting his skull and giving him a concussion. Langer wasn’t quite the same batter after the event, although continuing to play to surpass the admirable milestone of 100 Tests. After a lengthy internal battle, he made the decision to hang up his boots after the home victory in the 2006–07 Ashes campaign.</li><li>Since his retirement, Langer has consistently worked as a coach, especially at Western Australia, and has been recognized for his achievements in this area. It was anticipated that he will take over as coach of the Australian squad as soon as possible due to his tactical acumen and strong man-management skills. That became a reality in May 2018 when he took over as coach from Darren Lehmann after the sandpaper-gate controversy, which shook the foundation of Australian cricket.</li></ul><h2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Justin-Langer-2-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><h2>Justin Langer’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Justin Langer</strong> was an effective left-handed opening batsman for Australia in cricket.

Langer is wed to Sue Langer, an Australian lady. As of right now, it is unknown what she does throughout the workday. Justin proposed to Sue while they were still in high school, and they have been together ever since. Later, in 1996, Justin wed his high school love. Since that time, they have had a unique relationship.</p><p>Four girls were born to parents Justin and Sue. Jessica, Ali-Rose, Grace, and Sophie are the names of their daughters. Their oldest daughter is Ali-Rose, and their youngest is Jessica. Justin now resides at his Australian house with his daughter.</p><h2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Justin-Langer-4-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><h2>Interesting Facts</h2><ul><li>The fact that Langer has the most First-Class runs among Australians (28,382 at an average of 50.23) is his biggest claim to fame. After Don Bradman’s 117, his 86 hundreds rank second among Australians.</li><li>Robert Samuel “Robbie” Langer, Justin’s uncle, was a forceful left-handed batter who averaged 43.06 in First-Class cricket while mostly representing Western Australia.</li><li>Contrary to what many people think, Langer can be aggressive on occasion. He totaled 160 ODI runs at an 88.9 strike rate. Michael Hussey, Ricky Ponting, Hayden, Michael Clarke, Damien Martyn, and the Waughs all have lower strike rates to put things in context.</li></ul><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihrquknrtuuMCnnp6qXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

However, he appeared on Kayla’s IG for the first time a month before. Viewers of 90 Day Fiance remarked that Kayla looked like Jay’s estranged wife Ashley Morton.</p><p>He wrote in the post, “AFTER THE BAR YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS”. The new couple went public with their romance after Smith was released from U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement’s (ICE) custody last month. The Jamaican was facing deportation as a result of his failure to comply with a protection from abuse order issued by Martson, 33, during their divorce.</p><p>Ashley told the US that she learned about Kayla and Jay in January. “I was alerted about her in January,” she explained to Us. “So, I know, like, in the episode where the barbershop sat me down, I refer to a stripper. That’s who I was referring to.”</p><p>Meanwhile, she told InTouch Weekly, “[Kayla] used to be a stripper and she has changed her career over to a bottle service girl now.”</p><p>“There’s already a lot of rumors going around that his girlfriend, who’s running the GoFundMe, is pregnant,” Marston added,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>stoking pregnancy rumors</a>. “From what I saw — she was at court — she looked like she could’ve been expecting. So, like, if I [sponsor his visa], I would be responsible for paying his child support.”</p><p>They started dating amidst the second divorce filing between Jay and Ashley but broke up towards the end of 2019.</p><p>Following the breakup, Kayla stated to Radar, “We were happy. We always had a good time together We didn’t fight We still acted like best friends.” She felt that she “always did way more for him” in their relationship. She added, “Deep down, I think he is a good person, but he’s just lost.”</p><p>“Deep down, I think he is a good person, but he’s just lost,” she explained. “He was just moving on his motives and I had mine as well. We’re different people, who value different things.”</p><p>She added, “He’s a mess. I wish him peace.”</p><p>After the breakup between Jay and Kayla, he was spotted with Ashley again.</p><p>They were on and off from that point on. In 2021, Monster and Critics reported that Jay and Kayla were again living together.</p><p>Although the relationship was over, they kept getting tangled in controversies. They couldn’t live separate lives in peace as they keep getting tangled in controversies. In 2021, Ashley blasted Kayla for bragging about her ex-husband’s money. It all started when Jay shared a video of Kayla counting money that he made from his tattoo shop.</p><p>“Imagine posting money your man-made from me?! You’re welcome, sis!” Ashley dissed Kayla. She also called Kayla a “homewrecker”. She added, “A b***h just wants a divorce, so if you could kindly be the side chick that you are, can you tell him to sign the paperwork? That would be so great for me so I could move on with my life.”</p><p>Currently, they don’t feature on each other’s socials, as of 2022. So, we would like to conclude that they might have broken up again.</p><p>About Ashely’s previous relationship, she was engaged in December 2012 to her ex-fiance Joe Patterson (<a href=#>@joepa_25</a>).

According to reports, he is currently in a relationship with Suzu Hirose. Fans are wondering if he is engaged to his girlfriend, Suzu, but they are not.</strong></p><p>Just in time for the holidays, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Netflix</strong></a> has brought back <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Alice in Borderland</strong></a>. The second season of the Japanese thriller deadly Competition, which debuted on Netflix in December 2020, covers the remaining 33 chapters of <strong>Hara Asu's</strong> manga, while the first season focused primarily on the first 31 chapters. As a result, Season 2 definitively concludes the tale of Arisu's tragic time in Borderland, even though there is always a chance for additional seasons of the live-action version, particularly if this batch of episodes sells well.</p><p>The last round of games has been a whirlwind of blood, intestines, missing limbs, and life-defying obstacles, but somehow Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) and his friends including <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Chishiya</strong></a> (<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nijiro Murakami</strong></a>) have made it there. The participants of Alice in Borderland's second season have become even more obsessed with the idea of leaving the game of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>cards</strong></a>, and, at last, it appears that they will be able to do so. The Queen of Hearts, also known as Mira, is the only one still blocking their path (<strong>Minako Kotobuki</strong>).</p><p>Following a terrifying first season, the series' lead character Arisu, played by Kento Yamazaki, says there will be lots of changes and surprises in store for viewers, ranging from significant character changes to an in-depth look into the actor's personal life. Fans now wonder about his wife. Here are the details.</p><p>Previously we touched on <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Asahina Aya</strong></a>,&nbsp; <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jack of Hearts</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Queen of Spades</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Seven of Hearts</strong></a>.</p><h2>Kento Yamazaki Has Never Been Married and Does Not Have a Wife; He Is in a Relationship With His Girlfriend Suzu Hirose but Is Not Engaged!</h2><p>Many people adore <strong>Kento Yamazaki</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@kentooyamazaki</a>) and are interested in finding out more about him, especially regarding his personal life and his marital status as of 2022. The actor doesn't have a wife as of 2022.</p><p>Kento Yamazaki, a Japanese actor, has never married. According to reports, he is currently dating <strong>Suzu Hirose </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@suzu.hirose.official</a>). The couple's impending marriage, however, has not been reported. Kento and Suzu's love lives were revealed by <strong>Shukan Bunshun</strong>. Recently, multiple images of the couple together were made public. On June 18, the day before her 24th birthday, Suzu came home from work, and the actor took the picture while he waited for her.</p><p>The duo reportedly left the birthday girl's house separately, got into the same car that Kento was driving, and then drove back to Suzu's house late. Since they collaborated on the live-action <a href=# rel=noopener>adaptation</a> of Your Lie in April 2016, Yamazaki and Hirose have reportedly become close friends and may perhaps start dating. Fans are wondering if he is engaged to his girlfriend, Suzu, but they are not.</p><p>Suzu, a Japanese actress, is well known in her native country as one of the top performers of her generation. She was born on July 19, 1998, in Shizuko, Japan's Shimizu-Ku. She began her acting career in 2012 and is currently flourishing. Hirose began her modeling career for the Japanese edition of Seventeen. Then, both she and her sister were featured in the same magazine. In the movie Our Little Sister, Suzu shared the screen alongside well-known actresses <strong>Haruka Ayase</strong>, <strong>Masami Nagasawa</strong>, and <strong>Kaho</strong>.</p><p>In 2016, the couple co-starred in the live-action adaptation of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. The official from the entertainment industry goes on to claim that the two got along well during filming and that there were rumors that they were dating, which is usually the case when a guy and a woman are working together.</p><p>Remembering June 19, Suzu and Kento were observed leaving her house at around 2:00 PM. A young man and a woman of medium age joined them. The four climbed into Suzu's posh vehicle. They traveled to Tokyo Dome to attend The Fight 2022: Tenshin VS Takeru, a kickboxing match that is sponsored by <strong>Yogibo</strong>. While Suzu leaves the car later with the other two people to go buy event supplies, Kento Yamazaki exits the vehicle on his own. According to a Tokyo Dome event representative, the four reunited in a VIP box to watch the fight and avoid prying eyes.</p><p>Maybe due to the excitement of the battle, the pair did not worry about being spotted together as they headed to the parking lot. The two other individuals left shortly after they got back to Suzu's house in a cab. Suzu was picked up by her management to go to work the following morning. An hour later, Kento Yamazaki departed from his house and went back to his.</p><p>Kento Yamazaki has been linked to another woman as well. Although their relationship was not officially verified, Kento Yamazaki and <strong>Tao Tsuchiya</strong> were in a relationship in 2016 and 2017. After they were captured together in a photo by a BBQ restaurant, they fell silent.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>Check Out: <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Alice in Borderland Retry Plot</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=# rel=noopener>Celebs In-depth</a> for more <a href=# rel=noopener>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGiinqakpHq6rcyasZqjmWLEqrLEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

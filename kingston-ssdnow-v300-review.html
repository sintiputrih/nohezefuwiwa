Anand assembled the traces out of frustration with the majority of what we have today in terms of SSD benchmarks.</p><p>Although the AnandTech Storage Bench tests did a good job of characterizing SSD performance, they weren't stressful enough. All of the tests performed less than 10GB of reads/writes and typically involved only 4GB of writes specifically. That's not even enough exceed the spare area on most SSDs. Most canned SSD benchmarks don't even come close to writing a single gigabyte of data, but that doesn't mean that simply writing 4GB is acceptable.</p><p>Originally we kept the benchmarks short enough that they wouldn't be a burden to run (~30 minutes) but long enough that they were representative of what a power user might do with their system. Later, however, we created what we refer to as the Mother of All SSD Benchmarks (MOASB). Rather than only writing 4GB of data to the drive, this benchmark writes 106.32GB. This represents the load you'd put on a drive after nearly two weeks of constant usage. And it takes a&nbsp;long&nbsp;time to run.</p><p>1) The MOASB, officially called AnandTech Storage Bench 2011—Heavy Workload, mainly focuses on the times when your I/O activity is the highest. There is a lot of downloading and application installing that happens during the course of this test. Our thinking was that it's during application installs, file copies, downloading, and multitasking with all of this that you can really notice performance differences between drives.</p><p>2) We tried to cover as many bases as possible with the software incorporated into this test. There's a lot of photo editing in Photoshop, HTML editing in Dreamweaver, web browsing, game playing/level loading (Starcraft II and WoW are both a part of the test), as well as general use stuff (application installing, virus scanning). We included a large amount of email downloading, document creation, and editing as well. To top it all off we even use Visual Studio 2008 to build Chromium during the test.</p><p>The test has 2,168,893 read operations and 1,783,447 write operations. The IO breakdown is as follows:</p><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=1 width=575><tbody readability=1><tr class=tgrey readability=2><td align=center colspan=5>AnandTech Storage Bench 2011—Heavy Workload IO Breakdown</td></tr><tr class=tlblue><td width=120>IO Size</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>% of Total</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>4KB</td><td align=center valign=middle>28%</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>16KB</td><td align=center valign=middle>10%</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>32KB</td><td align=center valign=middle>10%</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>64KB</td><td align=center valign=middle>4%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Only 42% of all operations are sequential; the rest ranges from pseudo to fully random (with most falling in the pseudo-random category). Average queue depth is 4.625 IOs, with 59% of operations taking place in an IO queue of 1.</p><p>Many of you have asked for a better way to really characterize performance. Simply looking at IOPS doesn't really say much. As a result we're going to be presenting Storage Bench 2011 data in a slightly different way. We'll have performance represented as Average MB/s, with higher numbers being better. At the same time we'll be reporting how long the SSD was busy while running this test. These disk busy graphs will show you exactly how much time was shaved off by using a faster drive vs. a slower one during the course of this test. Finally, we will also break out performance into reads, writes, and combined. The reason we do this is to help balance out the fact that this test is unusually write intensive, which can often hide the benefits of a drive with good read performance.</p><p>There's also a new light workload for 2011. This is a far more reasonable, typical every day use case benchmark. It has lots of web browsing, photo editing (but with a greater focus on photo consumption), video playback, as well as some application installs and gaming. This test isn't nearly as write intensive as the MOASB but it's still multiple times more write intensive than what we were running last year.</p><p>We don't believe that these two benchmarks alone are enough to characterize the performance of a drive, but hopefully along with the rest of our tests they will help provide a better idea. The testbed for Storage Bench 2011 has changed as well. We're now using a Sandy Bridge platform with full 6Gbps support for these tests.</p><h2><strong>AnandTech Storage Bench 2011—Heavy Workload</strong></h2><p>We'll start out by looking at average data rate throughout our heavy workload test:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Heavy Workload 2011 - Average Data Rate" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph6733/54441.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Our Heavy suite also shows that the V300 performs similarly to most SandForce based SSDs. The HyperX is slightly faster but if you're looking for the fastest SSD, then Samsung SSD 840 Pro or OCZ Vector is your best choice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Heavy Workload 2011 - Average Read Speed" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph6733/54442.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="Heavy Workload 2011 - Average Write Speed" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph6733/54443.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="Heavy Workload 2011 - Disk Busy Time" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph6733/54444.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="Heavy Workload 2011 - Disk Busy Time (Reads)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph6733/54445.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="Heavy Workload 2011 - Disk Busy Time (Writes)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph6733/54446.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIN4f5JooqKml6jBsLqMrKqdpp%2Bserd%2Fj2lkq52mnrK4e5Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

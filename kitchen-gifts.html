They include ideas for everyone on your list: the home baker, the vegetable lover, the cook who’s obsessed with meal prep, that person who lives for their morning coffee, and really anyone who loves cooking.</p><p>These kitchen gift ideas range from all-star appliances to handy cooking tools to high-quality food items. Though they vary in size and price point, they’re all great additions to a home kitchen. You can’t go wrong!</p><h2>The Best Kitchen Gifts of 2024: Our Top Picks</h2><h2>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vitamix A3500 Ascent Series Smart Blender</a></h2><p>It’s impossible for me to write a kitchen gift guide without including a Vitamix blender, especially when they’re on sale! Vitamix makes the best high-speed blenders on the market. They stand the test of time (our editor Phoebe has had hers for almost 10 years!), and they can blend up the creamiest smoothies, sauces, and soups.</p><p>I currently own the <strong>Vitamix A3500 Ascent Series Smart Blender</strong>. This advanced blender has settings for smoothies, hot soups, dips, and frozen desserts. The 2.2 HP motor can easily puree tough ingredients like nuts—no soaking required. I also love their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">food processor attachment,</a> which is a great deal if you <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy it as a set with the blender.</a></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$533 at Amazon</a><h2>2. or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vitamix E310 Explorian Blender</a></h2><p>If you’re looking for kitchen gifts at a more accessible price point, I recommend the <strong>Vitamix E310 Explorian blender</strong>. It has a 2 HP motor and ten variable speeds to help you refine the texture of whatever you’re blending.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$289 at Amazon</a><h2><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/kitchen-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/both-cookbooks.jpg&description=Home+cooks+will+LOVE+these+kitchen+gifts%21+They+include+unique+ideas+for+bakers%2C+veggie+lovers%2C+the+coffee-obsessed%2C+and+more.")'></span></span></h2><h2>3. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Love and Lemons Simple Feel Good Food </a>(our newest cookbook is on sale!)</h2><p>If you know someone who’s looking for inspiration in the kitchen, my latest cookbook,&nbsp;Love and Lemons Simple Feel Good Food, would be an amazing gift. This&nbsp;New York Times-bestselling book is packed 125+ fresh, delicious recipes. Half the recipes are easy to make with on-hand ingredients, like quick weekday breakfasts, toss-together salads, and sheet pan dinners. The other half are designed for meal prep, like sturdy packable salads, freezer-friendly lasagnas, and make-ahead desserts.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$17.95 at Amazon</a><h2>4. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Love and Lemons Every Day Cookbook&nbsp;</a></h2><p>If you already have our newest cookbook, I highly recommend our second cookbook! Love and Lemons Every Day is packed with plant-based recipes for every occasion, from quick weeknight dinners to holiday meals. It also includes handy cooking charts (i.e., how to roast any vegetable, a giant grid of 5-ingredient salad dressings) and resources (like a list of what kitchen tools you actually need) to help readers become more confident and resourceful home cooks.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$19.79 at Amazon</a><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/kitchen-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/herb-scissors-2.jpg&description=31+Best+Kitchen+Gifts+of+2024")'></span></span></p><h2>5. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Herb Cutter Scissors</a></h2><p>Fresh herbs take any dish to another level, but I’ll be the first to admit that chopping them can get tedious. Enter: these herb cutter scissors! Equipped with 5 pairs of rust-resistant stainless steel blades, they allow you to cut herbs, dried chiles, and more quickly and efficiently. They come with a small cleaning brush and blade cover for safe storage.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$15.95 at Amazon</a><h2><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/kitchen-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwilling-knife.jpg&description=31+Best+Kitchen+Gifts+of+2024")'></span></span></h2><h2>6. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Zwilling Pro Le Blanc 7-Inch Slim Chef’s Knife</a></h2><p>We all know a home cook who wants to sharpen or replace their knives. Surprise them with a new chef’s knife as a gift! I’m a huge fan of all of Zwilling’s knives, but I especially love the smaller profile and lighter weight of this 7-inch knife. Compared to a traditional 8-inch chef’s knife, it fits more comfortably in my hand and is easier to maneuver for precise cutting. The white handle and carbon steel blade look striking too.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$79.95 at Amazon</a><h2>Stocking Stuffers for Cooks</h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/kitchen-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/stasher-tofu-press-1.jpg&description=31+Best+Kitchen+Gifts+of+2024")'></span></span></p><h2>7. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Stasher Reusable Silicone Storage Bags 4-Pack</a></h2><p>These silicone stasher bags are one of my favorite gifts for cooks cutting back on single-use plastic.

They’re easy to clean in the dishwasher!</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$41.24 at Amazon</a><h2>8. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tofuture Tofu Press</a></h2><p>A tofu press would be a great kitchen gift for the vegan or vegetarian in your life. I tested the <a href=#>best tofu presses</a> earlier this year, and the Tofuture Tofu Press was my favorite. Its compact size makes it easy to store, and with just 3 pieces, it’s super simple to use! After only 20 minutes of pressing, it yields ultra-firm, chewy tofu that’s perfect for grilling, baking, or pan-frying.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$21.99 at Amazon</a><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/kitchen-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/benriner-gift-1.jpg&description=31+Best+Kitchen+Gifts+of+2024")'></span></span></p><h2>9. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Benriner Mandoline Slicer</a></h2><p>If you know someone who loves cooking with vegetables, they’ll get so much use out of a mandoline. It’s perfect for cutting veggies into paper-thin slices, which are ideal for all sorts of salads, slaws, and pickles.

All of the pieces store neatly inside, and its container doubles as a container to catch your food as you slice. It’s a great gift for new cooks or for those who love functional gadgets that don’t take up a lot of storage space.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">22.95 at Amazon</a><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/kitchen-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/goldematcha-whiskset.jpg&description=31+Best+Kitchen+Gifts+of+2024")'></span></span></p><h2>11. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Golde Pure Matcha</a></h2><p>Surprise a tea lover with this ceremonial grade matcha from Golde! I tested the <a href=#>best matcha powders</a> earlier this year, and this matcha was our favorite to use in a <a href=#>matcha latte</a> and <a href=#>iced matcha</a>.

The 625-watt motor blends soups and sauces to smooth and creamy perfection, and the unique bell guard protects pots and pans from scratches. The blender has 5 variable speeds and a convenient long cord.

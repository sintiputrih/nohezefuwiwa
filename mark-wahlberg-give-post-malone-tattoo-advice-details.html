“I told him, eventually he’s gonna want to remove his and it’s gonna be painful,” said the 48-year-old actor in an interview with E! News. “It’s more painful taking them off. I’ve taken all mine off already.”
The father of four used to have several tattoos, two notable ones being a giant shoulder tattoo that said “Wahlberg” and a statement-making rosary bead necklace design that took up a solid amount of space on his chest."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In 2012, he began the long and painful process of removing his permanent ink.</p><p dir=ltr>In an interview with&nbsp;Today&nbsp;that same year, Wahlberg admitted that he doesn’t want his children getting tattoos. To try and convince two of them to stay away from the tattoo parlor, he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Matt Lauer</strong></a>, “I’ve taken my two older kids to the procedure so they see how painful it is and what I have to go through.”</p><p dir=ltr>But, unlike Wahlberg’s now-traumatized children, Post Malone doesn’t appear to have any interest in slowing down his tattoo game. He has over 50 designs, his latest being a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gauntlet face tattoo</a>, revealed at Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve celebration on the evening of December 31.</p><p dir=ltr>Believe it or not, the 24-year-old wasn’t always obsessed with tattoos. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Justin Bieber</strong> </a>was the reason why Post Malone got his first-ever design.</p><p dir=ltr>The “Sunflower” singer opened up about his first tattoo experience on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon in 2018.&nbsp;He said, “We were working on&nbsp;Stoney&nbsp;and then we had a tattoo artist come through, and I was like, ‘You know what? Justin Bieber’s got some tats, and I love you, but I know I’m way tougher than you.”</p><p dir=ltr>Ever since then, Post Malone’s gone under the tattoo gun time and time again.</p><p dir=ltr>Wahlberg isn’t the only star to open up about how painful tattoo removal is.

The popular Netflix thriller, which is also possibly Netflix’s most successful project to date, has a penchant for causing profound pain by murdering fan favorites like Sean Astin’s Bob and Quinn’s Eddie Munson.</p><p>Before Stranger Things season 5, the show also took off Dr. Martin Brenner (performed by Matt Modine), one of the least endearing characters. Despite the doctor’s untimely demise in the fight with Vecna, star Matt Modine believes that his character can return to the popular program for the concluding season.&nbsp;Stranger Things season 5 shooting is set to commence in May 2023, which means that the majority of the screenplay has already been written. But there’s still time to bring back Dr. Martin Brenner, if only in an appearance.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>season 5. chapter one. the crawl. happy stranger things day <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xCdNLjD7Yt</a></p><p>— Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">November 7, 2022</a></p><h2>What did Matt Modine have to say about his comeback to Stranger Things 5?</h2><p>In a recent interview with Radio Times, Matt Modine revealed that he was eager to return to his former part in the popular Netflix drama, even if it wasn’t in the same flesh as he had previously depicted it.&nbsp;His character was struck off after the prior season’s conclusion. Modine, on the other hand, believes that his image can be resurrected in some way. Modine stated in the interview:</p><p>“I wish I knew because I adore Millie Bobby Brown, I adore [creators] the Duffer brothers, and I adore [director] Shawn Levy, and it was such a joy to work on every day….&nbsp;I hope there is a chance to resurrect Dr. Brenner and include him in Season 5 because it would be fantastic to be a part of the final season.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Matt-Modine-1.jpg alt="Matt Modine" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>“We didn’t actually see him deceased; he was just laying in the ground. He survived the Demogorgon, and he survived Vecna in Season 4 Episode 1…”</p><p>While Dr. Brenner may be among the unlucky, the fifth season will feature many returning performers from the previous season. Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, Priah Ferguson, Cara Buono, Brett Gelman, Jamie Campbell Bower, and Eduardo Franco are among those who have joined the cast.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Matt-Modine-2.jpg alt="Matt Modine" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Shawn Levy and The Duffer Brothers will also return to film the majority of Stranger Things season 5 segments.

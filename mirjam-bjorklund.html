Because she is now below the top 100, she is competing in ITF competitions rather than WTA ones.</p><p>She struggled to qualify for ITF tournaments at the start of the year, with inconsistent results. However, as the year progressed, things began to improve.</p><p>In July, Bjorklund reached the semi-finals of an ITF/Tennis Europe event in Germany and then won a similar event in Belgium. She then advanced to the finals of an ITF event in Italy but was defeated.</p><p>She finished the year on a high note by winning an ITF/USTA event, giving her two ITF singles titles. Bjorklund was also successful in&nbsp;doubles ranks, where she won a further two titles.</p><p>She continues to balance her tennis career with her romance with Shapovalov and hence the best is yet to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kuqq%2ByZqkZpqapL%2BsuNSnm2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

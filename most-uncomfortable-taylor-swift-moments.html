But the star had enough in 2013 after presenters Amy Poehler and Tina Fey made reference to her at that year's Golden Globe Awards. In a <a href=#>video clip</a> of the event, Fey said, "You know what Taylor Swift? You stay away from Michael J. Fox's son." To which Poehler joked, "Or go for it!" The actor then said, "No, she needs some me time to learn about herself," seemingly shading Swift for her serial dating.</p><p>Swift clapped back in an issue of <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>. "You know, Katie Couric is one of my favorite people because she said to me she had heard a quote that she loved, that said, 'There's a special place in hell for women who don't help other women,'" she said. While the quote was attributed to former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during <a href=#>a 2006 speech at a WNBA event</a>, the message was clear. Swift was never, ever, getting back together with Poehler and Fey.&nbsp;</p><p>Fey addressed the drama, telling <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>, "I did not see that one coming. It was a joke. It was a lighthearted joke." As for Poehler, she was more sympathetic, telling <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>: "Aw, I feel bad if she was upset. I am a feminist and she is a young and talented girl." Eventually Swift cleared the air with Poehler at the <a href=#>2020 Golden Globes</a> when they presented together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxhaYRxfo6mpqysXaq7pLvMn6arrJGXuaZ505qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZKannZq7tb%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

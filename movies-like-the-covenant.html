In the film, interpreter Ahmed and U.S. Army Sergeant John Kinley are drawn into a battle with the Taliban. Kinley is injured and unconscious, but Ahmed manages to carry him across Afghanistan’s arid landscape and hostile climate to safety. The film demonstrates how people are not looking for debts, connections, or favours.</p><p>Jake Gyllenhaal, Dar Salim, Alexander Ludwig, Anthony Starr, and Emily Beecham are the film’s stars. The movie’s heroic idea is derived from the substance and emotion motivating the characters’ actions, not from the movie’s strong action and thrilling thrills. Here is a list of films that are similar if you liked the selfless deeds of bravery and unrestrained courage as much as we did. Several of these films, including “The Covenant,” are available to stream on <a href=#>Netflix</a>, Hulu, or Amazon Prime.</p><h3>12 Strong (2018)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/12-Strong-2018.jpg alt="best movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant and twilight,movies like the covenant on netflix,the covenant 2,movies like twilight,movies like shadowhunters,movies like seventh son,supernatural movies,movies like the covenant,similar movies like the covenant,top 10 movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant 2006,more movies like the covenant,movies like covenant" width=1024 height=462 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The action movie “12 Strong,” directed by Chris Hemsworth and starring Michael Shannon, tells the tale of the first Special Forces team to be sent to Afghanistan following the tragic events of 9/11. Based on the true account of the 12 troops who battled the Taliban on horses, the movie tells a compelling tale. The film “12 Strong” from filmmaker Nicolai Fuglsig is for you if you like the components of nonstop action and found the persistent struggle in the face of extreme danger in “The Covenenat” appealing.</p><h3>Green Zone (2010)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Green-Zone-2010.jpg alt="best movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant and twilight,movies like the covenant on netflix,the covenant 2,movies like twilight,movies like shadowhunters,movies like seventh son,supernatural movies,movies like the covenant,similar movies like the covenant,top 10 movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant 2006,more movies like the covenant,movies like covenant" width=1920 height=1080 sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Matt Damon plays Officer Roy Miller, the head of the US Army, in the Paul Greengrass-directed action thriller “Green Zone.” The film follows Miller’s travels as he looks for weapons of mass devastation in the Green Zone of Baghdad.</p><p>The cast of the film, which stars Matt Damon, Greg Kinnear, Jason Isaacs, Brendan Gleeson, and Amy Ryan, is based on the nonfiction book by Rajiv Chandrasekaran. If you like the intensity and thrill of the chase in “The Covenant,” you’ll undoubtedly enjoy the search for WMDs in “Green Zone.”</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u5303206d42ae6cd39a2eca6a1b64f8b0><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>7 Pant-shitting Scary Movies To Watch If You Like Skinamarink 2022</span></a><h3>Lions for Lambs (2007)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Lions-for-Lambs-2007.jpg alt="best movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant and twilight,movies like the covenant on netflix,the covenant 2,movies like twilight,movies like shadowhunters,movies like seventh son,supernatural movies,movies like the covenant,similar movies like the covenant,top 10 movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant 2006,more movies like the covenant,movies like covenant" width=1023 height=682 sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>In order to live meaningful lives and dedicate their lives to saving others, Arian and Ernest leave the country and travel to Afghanistan in the movie, which tells their journey. As their experiences in Afghanistan tell a story of hopelessness and humanity, a another tale is being told in Washington, where a journalist and a presidential candidate have a chance encounter that alters both of their lives.</p><p>The film is a compelling tale about how senior politicians make poor decisions because they are unaware of the situation on the ground. Robert Redford, <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>, Meryl Streep, Andrew Garfield, and Derek Luke all appear in the film. The Covenant’s similar depiction of the nature of war and its longing endeavours makes this the ideal film for you to watch next. It is also directed by Robert Redford.</p><h3>Sand Castle (2017)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sand-Castle-2017.jpg alt="best movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant and twilight,movies like the covenant on netflix,the covenant 2,movies like twilight,movies like shadowhunters,movies like seventh son,supernatural movies,movies like the covenant,similar movies like the covenant,top 10 movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant 2006,more movies like the covenant,movies like covenant" width=989 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Nothing can adequately prepare you for the enormous responsibility that the word “war” carries; this is the issue that “Sand Castle” explores. The plot of the film centres on Matt Ocre, a young soldier sent to an Iraqi town to restore the water supply. But when this seemingly hopeless effort becomes a hazardous undertaking, the resulting circumstances allow for guts and courage to undertake it.</p><p>The film is directed by Fernando Coimbra and stars Nicolas Hoult, Henry Cavill, Logan Marshall-Green, and Glen Powell. You will find “Sand Castle” to be just as captivating and intriguing as “The Covenant” since it depicts the harsh realities of war that can change you totally.</p><h3>The Hurt Locker (2008)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Hurt-Locker-2008.jpg alt="best movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant and twilight,movies like the covenant on netflix,the covenant 2,movies like twilight,movies like shadowhunters,movies like seventh son,supernatural movies,movies like the covenant,similar movies like the covenant,top 10 movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant 2006,more movies like the covenant,movies like covenant" width=1364 height=768 sizes="(max-width: 1364px) 100vw, 1364px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The cast, led by Anthony Mackie and Jeremy Renner, allows filmmaker Kathryn Bigelow to highlight the exponential conditions that EODs must operate in. When an insurgent targets their unit, an explosive ordinance disposal unit, or EOD, works to disable bombs. The video exhibits the strains of fighting and changes tempo quickly. Thus if you found the reverent themes of bravery and daring in “The Covenant” to be uplifting, “The Hurt Locker” will likewise highlight the heroic stories of EOD.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u790d316c0bad08656f744b8460fe1948><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>9 Horror Movies Like 'X' You Should Watch For Sleepless Nights</span></a><h3>The Lone Survivor (2013)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Lone-Survivor-2013.jpg alt="best movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant and twilight,movies like the covenant on netflix,the covenant 2,movies like twilight,movies like shadowhunters,movies like seventh son,supernatural movies,movies like the covenant,similar movies like the covenant,top 10 movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant 2006,more movies like the covenant,movies like covenant" width=1024 height=577 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The story of a team of NAVY SEALs sent on a surveillance mission to find and kill the Taliban leader is depicted in this unpolished yet incredibly potent action. The SEALs are able to locate him, but they decide against killing them right away. The Taliban fighters are simultaneously informed of the mission by the Afghans, and a horrible battle results.</p><p>The Peter Berg-directed film illustrates how the SEALs are outnumbered and outgunned. The main cast, which includes Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, and Ben Foster, portrays the amazing journey of bravery and human strength. As a result, if you like the spirit of righteousness in “The Covenant,” this film is what you should watch next.</p><h3>The Outpost (2020)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Outpost-2020.jpg alt="best movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant and twilight,movies like the covenant on netflix,the covenant 2,movies like twilight,movies like shadowhunters,movies like seventh son,supernatural movies,movies like the covenant,similar movies like the covenant,top 10 movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant 2006,more movies like the covenant,movies like covenant" width=1024 height=621 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The central theme of Rob Lurie’s “The Outpost” is the concerted, unprovoked assault by Taliban fighters that left a small group of US forces at the outlying Combat Outpost Keating all by themselves. One of the worst battles of the Afghanistan War in 2009, it shows how the isolated soldiers were subjected to an overwhelming assault.</p><p>Scott Eastwood, Orlando Bloom, Milo Gibson, Caleb Landry Jones, Taylor John Smith, and Jacob Scipio are included in the cast. This is the movie you should watch next if you like seeing the hero backed into a corner and triumphing against all odds in “The Covenant.”</p><h3>War Machine (2017)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/War-Machine-2017.jpg alt="best movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant and twilight,movies like the covenant on netflix,the covenant 2,movies like twilight,movies like shadowhunters,movies like seventh son,supernatural movies,movies like the covenant,similar movies like the covenant,top 10 movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant 2006,more movies like the covenant,movies like covenant" width=1024 height=682 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The plot of the film centres on four-star general Glenn McMahon, who is selected to lead the NATO forces in Afghanistan. Nevertheless, when he is brought down by a journalist’s frank exposé of him, everything is turned upside down. <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>, Topher Grace, Anthony Michael Hall, and John Magaro are among the cast members. David Michod is the film’s director. The idea of “War Machine” is that McMahon and his team are attempting to negotiate the circumstances on the ground, much like “The Covenant.” As a result, if you like the details of the actual battles in “The Covenant,” you’ll likely enjoy this film as well.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="best movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant and twilight,movies like the covenant on netflix,the covenant 2,movies like twilight,movies like shadowhunters,movies like seventh son,supernatural movies,movies like the covenant,similar movies like the covenant,top 10 movies like the covenant,movies like the covenant 2006,more movies like the covenant,movies like covenant" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.

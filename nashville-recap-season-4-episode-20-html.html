(Well, that and the paycheck from Vulture … but I digress.) It was the flashes of greatness. The wonderful cast. The moments when the show actually showed us how great it could be — like a peacock giving us a glimpse of its magnificent feathers. (I know, wrong network.) And now it’s got one episode left. I’m going to miss the hell out of it. Unless, like, Hulu picks it up or something.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-6-0-0@published data-word-count=4>Let’s recap, shall we?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-7-0-0@published data-word-count=21>So Deacon and Rayna go to a couples’ therapist who is clearly an Obama impersonator in his free time.

Luke mumbles something about Will having experienced a loss, but the ladies of <i>The View</i> are having none of it. Will was dodging questions about his sexuality before his mama went off to the Grand Ole Opry in the sky, they note. Damn, you gotta wake up pretty early in the morning to get something past those crafty ladies of <i>The View</i>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-22-0-0@published data-word-count=75>Moving along. Juliette has an extremely blurry scene with Noah West on her airplane. (I think it was just natural daylight distorting the picture? But it was so blurry I briefly thought it was a dream sequence.) Juliette says she’ll see him at the Oscars where they’ll “pick up where they left off,” but Noah has other ideas. He shows up, unannounced at her house, and almost immediately launches into an infomercial for spaghetti squash.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-23-0-0@published data-word-count=20>“Control your nutrition!” Noah enthuses. “Supercharge your body.” (It’s extremely bizarre — it feels like product placement, without the product.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-24-0-0@published data-word-count=11>“Neat,” Juliette replies, in a hilariously diffident, Rizzo-from-<i>Grease</i> kind of way.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-25-0-0@published data-word-count=22>Avery comes over to drop off Cadence and he’s adorably — and unfairly, in light of his thing with Layla — jealous.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-26-0-0@published data-word-count=31>“That was fast,” he says, when he sees Noah in the kitchen. (Also, he really wants to taste Noah’s spaghetti squash doesn’t he? It’s his pride that gets in the way.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-27-0-0@published data-word-count=124>Later, Cadence is teething and colicky and Juliette calls Avery who keeps glancing at his phone, <i>while he’s on stage</i> (is this <i>Nashville</i>’s version of texting while driving?), but Noah saves the day by bringing in a wooden spoon for Cadence to gnaw on, just like the original settlers did. This gets Cadence to sleep so Juliette and Noah can settle in to watch that cinematic masterpiece <i>Tommy Boy</i>, which — dealbreaker alert! — Noah doesn’t like (“It’s a complete mess. The plot is all over the place.”) Juliette shoots him a look that basically says, “We are so done,” but at least is smart enough to have sex with him with him before dumping his pretty ass. Girl is no fool. Bye, Noah!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-28-0-0@published data-word-count=144>As usual, every last thing about Will Lexington: Gay Cowboy plotline seems overwrought and a bit too on-the-nose, like some dated PSA on the dangers of homophobia they show you in high school. In today’s installment: Colt gets beat up at boot camp for defending his father and lands in the hospital, with an elaborately bandaged concussion (guess he didn’t cut his hair, after all) and some broken bones. Luke’s father, of course, blames Luke for what happened, but Colt wakes up and says, “I’m proud of you, dad.” Suck it, mean old Grandpa Wheeler! Since Luke is at the hospital, Will does a radio show in his place and looks hella uncomfortable when the DJ asks him what his influence has been on the gay community. (“I can’t speak for anyone else. All I know is that I’m real proud of this album.”)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-29-0-0@published data-word-count=146>When Will gets home, there’s some dude leaning against his car, waiting for him in the dark. Of course, we all think he’s going to jump Will, but instead he says, “You’re wrong you know. You are speaking for other people. I had a real hard time coming to terms with who I am. I was so ashamed. … But hearing you stand up and speak your truth, it gave me the confidence to know that I could do it, too.” Oh, bless the earnestness of this scene. (Right about now, tenth graders forced to watch this in social studies class are nodding sagely.) Anyway, as a result of this encounter, Will decides he’s going to take on Cynthia Davis, face-to-face. Raise your hand if you think Will is going to triumphantly vanquish her on live TV? Okay, you can all put your hands down now.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-30-0-0@published data-word-count=166>Over in Scarlett and Gunnar land, things are still … not good. Gunnar goes off with Autumn to meet Elton John, and Scarlett goes off to shoot her headphones commercial. On the bright side, Scarlett has reached the “jaunty pageboy cap” stage of her bob. At the photoshoot, there’s a really cute mock-up of Scarlett representing Joy, except the photographer (that’s Brooke Smith a.k.a. “the girl in the ditch” from <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>, just in case that was driving you nuts) seems to think she’s making some sort of edgy Sundance contender instead of a commercial for cheap headphones. She encourages Scarlett to listen to the music and really <i>feel </i>things and, frankly, she’s a better therapist than Fauxbama. Within minutes, Scarlett is having flashbacks to all the good times with Gunnar and she’s crying and she (finally!) admits that she’s in love with him. (It’s awesome that Scarlett has this breakthrough and all, but that is going to be one shitty headphone ad.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-31-0-0@published data-word-count=70>Meanwhile, Gunnar gets to perform onstage with Elton John and it’s the cutest thing ever because Gunnar is supposed to be giddy, but it’s clear that Sam Palladio is also totally fan-boying. They sound awesome together, but riddle me this: Is “Blue Wonderful” a pun that I’m just not getting? After, Autumn Chase hits on him for the zillionth time and, in his post-Elton John glow, Gunnar finally succumbs. Naturally.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-32-0-0@published data-word-count=55>The final scene has Deacon and Rayna in bed together but a million miles apart — both awake, but not facing each other. Finally, Rayna reaches out and touches his arm and he takes her hand, and thank the Lord there’s a little bit of hope for these two because the clock is seriously ticking.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-05b37924e3c88b55509a6f67948a6d2f-33-0-0@published data-word-count=87>My biggest fear of course is that next week is going to end on a series of cliffhangers — I mean, they just found out they were cancelled a few days ago, there couldn’t possibly be time for reshoots, right? — and we’re all going to be left dangling in some sort of permanent <i>Nashville</i> purgatory where Avery is still with Layla, Scarlett finds out about Autumn, Maddie is still emancipated, and Deacon and Rayna are barely speaking. Deep breaths, my friends.

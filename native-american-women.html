Her father led one faction of the tribe, which believed that the Omaha needed to start accepting some white customs. The other faction, led by medicine men and traditionalists, called their rivals’ log cabins “The Village of the Make-Believe White Men.”</p><p>But La Flesche Picotte saw the need for some modernization. And she saw the need for a Native American to lead it. As a child, she remembered sitting with an old, sick woman who was waiting for a white doctor to treat her. Though he promised to come, he never did — and the woman died.</p><p>“It was only an Indian,” La Flesche Picotte recalled, “and it [did] not matter.”</p><p>Determined to make a difference, La Flesche Picotte enrolled in the Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania. In 1886, she took the train across the country at age 21 so that she could become a doctor. Few women — of any race — in the late 19th century took such a step. At the time, male doctors had <a href=# rel=noopener>claimed</a> that academic stress could make women infertile.</p><p>Undeterred, La Flesche Picotte graduated first in her class and became the first Native American woman to earn a medical degree. Though she was encouraged to practice on the East Coast, she chose to return home to the Omaha Reservation to treat vulnerable patients there. Before long, she became the primary physician for more than 1,200 people.</p><p>Sometimes, the work could be taxing. La Flesche Picotte often traveled for hours in inclement conditions to reach people, some of whom distrusted her unfamiliar diagnoses. But La Flesche Picotte kept at it — treating both Native American and white patients —&nbsp;and even raised enough money to build a modern hospital in the reservation town of Walthill, Nebraska.</p><p>She died in 1915, eulogized by both local priests and members of the Omaha.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyvrdOirZ5lkaKys7XCmqVmr5%2Bisq8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Since 2011, he has welcomed 12 children, five of which were born in 2022 alone, and nine born in the span of two years. They are <strong>Monroe, Moroccan, Golden Sagon, Powerful Queen, Zion Mixolydian, Zillion Heir, Legendary Love, Onyx Ice, Rise Messiah, Beautiful Zeppelin</strong>, and <strong>Halo Marie</strong>. He had another son, Zen, born in 2021, though he died at five months old after being diagnosed with brain cancer.</p><p id=evStVyLlQFS data-wc=41>Now, after<strong>&nbsp;Bre Tiesi,</strong> who he shares son Legendary Love with, born in July of 2022, claimed on popular Netflix reality show Selling Sunset that he doesn't have to pay child support, her own lawyer is coming to the father-of-twelve's defense.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Nick Cannon thanks fans for outpouring of love following son's passing</figure><p id=eBAAtxLOcYk data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Jamie Foxx's famous replacement on Beat Shazam revealed amid ongoing medical complication</a></p><p id=ebldSv0O__q data-wc=51>On season six of the show, which aired Friday, Bre claimed: "The way it works is, like, after 10, the court can basically say he can't afford to pay child support. Or because he is who he is, they could say, 'We know you can afford X amount for each household.'"</p><p id=e9VaL_WzV_M data-wc=30>However, her lawyer Neama Rahmani has called out her client's claims as "absolutely not true," and even told her via an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly</a>: <strong>"Bre, you should know better!"</strong></p><p id=ePp1NCDmu5O data-wc=17><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Nick Cannon's insane birthday party for 12-year-old twins – and you'll never believe what he did</a></strong></p><p id=ePWNvfWdNv2 data-wc=34>She explained: "There's no cap on child support based on the number of children. So, to the extent that Nick Cannon can have babies, he owes child support for those babies under California law."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c872abab6b5f-screen-shot-2023-05-20-at-105547-am.png><p id=ejQm-foh5W4 data-wc=49>Then, in a subsequent statement to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Entertainment Tonight</a>, she said: "I was clarifying that Nick has a legal obligation to pay child support under California law. I didn't address whether the mothers of his children have requested child support or whether Nick has paid it to Bre or others."</p><p id=eX9GVR85gMda data-wc=12><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Mariah Carey celebrates twins Moroccan and Monroe's birthdays with rare photos</a></strong></p><p id=eI_h1WjUMU data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Nick Cannon welcomes 11th baby as Abby De La Rosa gives birth&nbsp;</a></p><p id=erQtaPZvWg9 data-wc=50>Further speaking of her relationship with the father of her son, Bre said: <strong>"I take care of myself, and if my son needs something or we need something, I can ask. That's all I have to do. I know he's a good dad. And Nick is not my sugar daddy."</strong></p><p id=eMHXvWFe0kTS data-wc=45>She added: "Nick is not my reason that I'm where I'm at – he's none of these things. It's stupid. I can make crazy money by myself. I can carry my lifestyle, which is not cheap. I can carry my child and my own [expletive]."</p><p id=e9T9qxf7cob2 data-wc=40>Her lawyer did maintain that part of what she said on the show was of course true, and defended her with: "Bre is a successful actress, model and real estate agent.

In that respect, it’s the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris after allegedly enduring a chase by the paparazzi. Her life was also highly scrutinized by the media.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Being here now, 22 years later, trying to finish what she started will be incredibly emotional," Harry said in the interview, which took place during his and Duchess Meghan's royal tour of southern Africa.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"But, everything that I do reminds me of her,” he continued. “But as I said—with the role, with the job, and sort of the pressures that come with that—I get reminded of the bad stuff.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The preview also mentions that Tom Bradby later asks Meghan about the difficulties of living a highly publicized life after marrying into the British royal family.

The Bravo stars just filmed their Halloween episode and are sharing photos in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their amazing costumes</a> with fans. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Teresa Giudice</strong></a> looked like a confectionary treat, dressing as a stick of cotton candy. The 48-year-old wore a puffy pink tulle outfit that covered her mid-section, with a pink, blue and purple wig and a blue and white striped cotton candy wand attached to the top of her head.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><span title=Edited>“I’m the sweetest BITCH you’ll ever meet. tis the season … Are you a trick or a treat?” Teresa teased in the caption of the photo.&nbsp;</span>Her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ex-husband</a><strong>&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Joe Giudice</a></strong>&nbsp;sent his adoration <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>from Italy</a>, writing in the comments, “You look sweet.” In another picture that also showed her amazingly detailed makeup job by <a class=notranslate href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@priscilladistasio</a>, Tre wrote, “I’m just here for the Cotton Candy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Tre’s sister in law <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Melissa Gorga</a></strong>, 41, made for a stunning mermaid. She wore a metallic gold fishnet-style one shoulder top that showed off her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>toned bare abs</a>. Melissa paired it with a pink sequin mermaid style skirt with a few rips in it, courtesy of her husband <strong>Joe</strong>. He went as a mermaid fisherman, complete with a net. Melissa wrote in the caption of an IG picture of the two in costume, “He caught the mermaid.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Aydin</strong></a>, 43, paid tribute to another famous Jennifer, wearing a rendition of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>JLo</strong></a>‘s iconic <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>green plunging <strong>Versace</strong> gown</a> that the singer famously wore to the 2000 MTV VMAs. JLo later closed Versace’s Sept 2019 fashion show <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wearing a near replica</a> of the dress, looking like a goddess at age 50. That was the look Aydin went for, big hair and all. Her husband <strong>Bill</strong> went as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Prince</strong></a>, wearing a purple long duster and the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>late music god</a>‘s trademark white ruffled shirt. He added a black curly wig to complete the look.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dolores Catania</strong></a>&nbsp;crushed her costume, going as a sexy plastic surgery victim. “It hurts to be beautiful,” she wrote in the caption of her Instagram photo, showing her wearing bandages around her head, neck and other parts of her body. She added bloody red makeup to show breast implant scars and a face lift line atop her forehead. The 49-year-old has admitted to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>getting a few nips and tucks</a> herself, but told her surgeons in the caption, “Don’t worry&nbsp;@drkarolak&nbsp;and&nbsp;@drjosephmichaels it’s just a costume.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17><strong>Margaret Josephs</strong>, 53, and <strong>Jackie Goldschneider</strong>, 44, went with couples costumes, bringing their significant others along to match in their Halloween fun. Margaret went as Morticia Addams while her husband <strong>Joe Benigno </strong>dressed as her husband Gomez Addams. Jackie and her husband <strong>Evan</strong> went old school as mid 70s music and TV icons <strong>Sonny</strong> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cher</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Finally, show newcomer <strong>Michelle Pais</strong> already fits in perfectly with the rest of the cast, at least when it comes to creative Halloween costumes. The Signature Realty NJ founder’s husband <strong>Jonathan</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Steingraver</strong> dressed as late<strong> Chanel</strong> designer <strong>Karl Lagerfeld</strong>, while Michelle went as Karl’s beloved fluffy white cat Choupette. Michelle donned a white wig and ears, along with a white faux-fur top and ice blue eye contacts to resemble the style icon’s pet.&nbsp;“I never thought I’d like cats, until I met choupette ~ Karl Lagerfeld,” Michelle added to her caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>There have been reports that the Halloween party will be the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season 11 finale</a> for the Real Housewives of New Jersey, so fans might have to wait for awhile to see what went down while everyone was in costume. The season 11 premiere isn’t scheduled to air on Bravo until Feb. 2021. For now, the awesome costume looks will have to do for eager viewers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe5FtZqugn6O3bq%2FArKtmoJGhubDDxJ6lZpufqMG2ucSsZGtoYmV6sbXCrGStnaKawKJ5xqKsnaGTmnqxtM6tpqxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

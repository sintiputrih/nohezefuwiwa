"That's part of our conversation regularly of, like, just being prepared.

I'm not going to do that kind of thing,' and I was like, 'Well, that doesn't mean that you can't be an advocate, or an activist, or volunteer.'"</p><p id=eNEyPxwMgX9 data-wc=41>Rosario continued: "She started drawing all of these really amazing posters around conservation and anti-violence and it was just powerful.

She got her start as a stand-up comedian at various clubs, but her career’s turning point was competing on ‘Star Search’ in 1984. Consecutive wins on the entertainment competition show led to recurring roles on the television sitcoms ‘Gimme a Break!’ and ‘Stand by your Man.’ Her film career, however, really blew up with roles in classics like ‘A League of Their Own,’ ‘Sleepless in Seattle,’ ‘Harriet the Spy,’ ‘The Flinstone,’ ‘Tarzan’ and ‘Beautiful Girls.’ After the turn of the century, she was also praised for her role as Tutu in ‘SMILF’ (the show ran between 2017 and 2019).&nbsp;</p><p>Rosie cemented her position among Hollywood royalty with her daytime talk show, ‘The Rosie O’Donnell Show,’ which earned her multiple Emmy Awards. The show ran between 1996 and 2002, and in 2006, Rosie moved on to ‘The View’ as a co-host and moderator between 2006 and 2007. Rosie also filmed her own show, ‘The Rosie Show,’ for the Oprah Winfrey Network between 2011 and 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>Rosie is currently playing the role of Lisa Sheffer in the HBO series, ‘I Know&nbsp; This Much Is True.’ She has five children: Chelsea Belle O’Donnell, Parker Jaren O’Donnell, Blake Christopher O’Donnell, Dakota O’Donnell and Vivienne Rose O’Donnell.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZL%2Bwv8ieZKhllKS7r7HLpWSpoZOofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

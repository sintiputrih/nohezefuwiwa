When word began spreading that Ridley Scott really was looking to make a Blade Runner sequel, some 30 years after the original, one of the first questions everybody asked was, “Is anybody from the first movie coming back for the sequel?” Most of that speculation has centered around Harrison Ford’s Deckard, but might other actors from Blade Runner reprise their roles?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There’s nothing official, but it turns out that actress Sean Young has already had a meeting about the sequel.</p><p>Speaking to Crave Online, Young said that she had indeed met with Alcon Entertainment, the production company behind <i>Blade Runner 2</i>. Young played the replicant Rachael who, depending on which cut of the film you prefer, may have flown off to live happily ever after with Deckard at the end of the movie. Unsurprisingly, Ms. Young thinks Rachael deserves a comeback:</p><p>Well, I did meet with Alcon, the company that owns it and is planning to do the remake with Ridley. I did meet with them, but I think at that point they just wanted to meet me and I don’t think they have any plans of using any of the original people, although I can’t say for sure. I do think, let me just say it right here, I do think it would be a disappointment to the audience not to have Rachel in it but you know what, folks in Hollywood make mistakes all the time.<span id=more-44549></span></p><p>I can’t say Rachael would be on my short list of must-have elements for any new <i>Blade Runner</i> film, but whatever. But wait, aren’t those pesky replicants supposed to have a four-year lifespan? Young says, “Oh no, in the interpretation I’m the one that has no end date. I’m the one that rides off in the car with him at the end that has no end date. I’m Nexus-7, not Nexus-6.”</p><p>Even if the story has a way for Rachael to return in some capacity for the sequel, they’re going to run up against the same problem as Brent Spiner in the <i>Next Generation</i> movies: why is she aging? And honestly, if they’re going to come up with some loophole about how replicants can age if blah blah blah, I have a feeling they’d spend that suspension of disbelief on getting Ford back into Deckard’s trench coat long before they called Sean Young.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Young has doggedly pursued a role. The story of how she showed up in a homemade outfit to <a href=#>try out for Catwoman</a> in <i>Batman Returns</i> is something of a Hollywood legend. I wonder if she was dressed as Rachael during the Alcon meeting. Or if the Alcon meeting was actually just her shouting at a homeless guy for 20 minutes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irk56zqnvSnpinZamkwq%2BzjJujmpyVYr%2B2us2eqWZqXaKypsDIp55noKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

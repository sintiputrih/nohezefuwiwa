Mark David Chapman might be innocent in the murder of John Lennon, according to a British author and TV producer who said his upcoming documentary and book outline how a second shooter might have killed the iconic singer.
Chapman may have been brainwashed by the CIA to serve as a patsy, according to David Whelan, who spent three years investigating what he called astonishing inconsistencies in the official narrative of Lennon’s 1980 slaying as well as weird coincidences."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

No one disputes that Chapman was the gunman. He’s <a href=#>confessed repeatedly and apologized</a>.”</p><p>Whelan still can’t explain exactly what happened.</p><p>“The motive isn’t totally clear, and it doesn’t necessarily have to be a CIA/Deep State operation,” he said. “There are links between fundamentalist Christians and these hypnotist doctors and Nixon as well. Nixon and Lennon were arch enemies, and Nixon was close to [Ronald] Reagan,” who was president-elect when the former Beatle was shot.</p><p>“Lennon was just coming out of his shell and getting back to political activity and Reagan was coming into office,” Whelan observed.</p><p>Whelan alleges that key information surrounding the assassination was “hushed up” by the NYPD and the District Attorney’s office and said the autopsy report was never released by then-Medical Examiner Elliot Gross.</p><p>But Wedge said he and his co-authors saw the autopsy report during their research and didn’t find any major discrepancies.</p><p>Whelan uncovered numerous documents in the case. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a> was the first to publish Chapman’s “hit list,” courtesy of Whelan, which included newsman Walter Cronkite, late-night host Johnny Carson, actors George C.

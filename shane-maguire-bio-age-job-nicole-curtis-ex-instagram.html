Learn about their relationship and details of their custody battle.</p><p>Moreover, who is Shane’s new wife in 2022? What job does he do?</p><p>We try to answer all the questions here in this article.</p><h3><strong>Meet Shane Maguire, Nicole Curtis Ex</strong></h3><p>Shane Maguire and actress Nicole Curtis reportedly met each other in Minnesota. They were together as early as 2012 and dated at least until 2014. In January 2014, she wrote a status about a birthday gift she received from Shane on her Facebook.</p><p>Nicole wrote, “Just because everyone keeps asking–it’s a 1962 Chevy (4 on the floor) –it was my 36th Birthday gift from Shane aka Mister. And we had to have seatbelts installed -Ethan thought it was unsafe “let me guess, no airbags either, right, mom?”</p><p>However, they were reportedly in an on-and-off relationship before they called it quits. Nicole ended up getting pregnant with her son Harper and they split just before that. Later, Harper Maguire was born on 5 July 2015.</p><p>Then, Nicole moved to Detroit, Michigan, after giving birth to Harper. And that was the start of their ugly legal battle.</p><h3><strong>Shane Maguire And Nicole Curtis Custody Battle</strong></h3><p>A DNA test had established Harper’s fatherhood, and in November 2015, Shane Maguire filed court papers to request partial custody of the infant boy as well as parenting time.</p><p>The court bestowed joint custody to Shane and parenting time on alternate weekends, with additional visitation time over the summer. It was agreed that Nicole would provide primary physical care during the weekdays, and Shane would watch the child on weekends.</p><p>The name of Maguire was also&nbsp;<a class=H href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/oakland-county/2016/08/24/rehab-addict-star-court-hearing/89258578/>added</a> to Harper’s birth certificate, and his name was changed to Harper Wolfgang Lewis Curtis-Maguire.</p><p>Nicole, who wasn’t satisfied with the verdict, chose to alter the original agreement. A few months later, Nicole submitted a request, citing Harper’s continued breastfeeding, to deny Shane nighttime custody of him until he was at least two years old.</p><p>Nicole was a staunch supporter of breastfeeding Harper for an extended period of time. The custody dispute was centered on this issue since Nicole claimed she was unable to pump enough breastmilk to keep Harper alive for an overnight visit to his father.</p><p>Nicole had to provide medical evidence with the help of a lactation specialist to show that she was physically unable of pumping enough breast milk for Harper’s time with his father when a judge ordered her to do so.</p><p>“People ask me what it’s like to work in a male-dominated industry”, Curtis wrote in an Instagram post from 2017 in part, and she continued, “Now ask me about the struggle of having my breasts discussed in an open courtroom.”</p><p>Nicole also shared how embarrassing it was to sit in front of a stranger topless to demonstrate that her body could not, in fact, pump enough milk. She added, “Then the humiliation of having to put that document on the public record and sit in a courtroom of strangers all privy to an open discussion about my body”.</p><p>Meanwhile, Shane charged Nicole with using breastfeeding as a justification to keep him away from their kid during their custody dispute, but Nicole shot back by claiming she was employing baby-led weaning.</p><p>The residence shared by Harper and Nicole was a source of animosity between the ex-couples. Following Shane’s relocation to Detroit to be near the boy, Nicole allegedly moved to California without prior notice. In July 2018, Shane filed documents requesting Harper’s sole custody, alleging Nicole was “not a fit mother” and was attempting to undermine the bond between his kid and his father.</p><p>The businessman added that co-parenting with his baby mother was “a nightmare” since she kept changing the times and locations where they were meant to meet to swap Harper.</p><p>After nearly three years of minor conflicts, the ex-couples ultimately came to an understanding in October 2018. According to reports, Harper’s parents agreed to maintain shared legal and physical custody and “share equal responsibility and decision-making authority” for the boy’s welfare.</p><p>In order to protect Harper’s relationship with his parents, they also agree to refrain from criticizing one another in Harper’s presence. The agreement specifies that neither parent may change Harper’s appearance without the other’s consent. After Shane gave Harper his first haircut without Nicole’s permission, this issue surfaced during the custody dispute.</p><p>Additionally, Nicole consented to establish a $250,000 trust fund for Harper. Also, Shane received permission to use it to buy a house in California so that he could be close to the child. However, by the time Harper is 19 years old, Shane must have reimbursed the funds.</p><h3><strong>Shane Maguire Wife Now</strong></h3><p>There isn’t any information on his current wife as Shane Maguire tends to keep away his current dating life away from the limelight.

Receiving a mysterious envelope after meeting Joey for the very first time — which was long before the other 31 contestants did — the Hawaii native was already coming in with a leg up on the competition, but according to Reality Steve, the contents of the envelope ultimately sealed her fate as the First Impression Rose recipient.</p><p>“The biggest story of night one was what happened with Lea, the girl who met Joey on the ‘After The Final Rose’ special of Charity’s season, and was a given a card that she couldn’t open until the night of the limo entrances. Back on October 18th, I spoiled on Instagram that the letter gave her the opportunity to steal someone’s one-on-one at any point during the season, however, Lea decided against that and threw the letter in the fire. She said she felt like she wanted to be chosen by Joey for a one-on-one and not have to steal one from someone else. Joey respected this decision and, in turn, gave Lea the First Impression Rose.”</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>Technically this was Lea’s second impression, but we could not be happier for her nonetheless.</p><p data-characters=528 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>As for who Lea actually is, the 23-year-old was born and raised in Hawaii, however, she has attended school in both Washington and Arizona, pursued a career in California, and more. While she has lived all over the western half of the United States, she is still extremely proud of her Hawaiian roots, considering herself a “cliff diving enthusiast” who absolutely adores the beach, canoeing, hiking, painting, and more. She even plays the flute, and dreams of teaching others music someday — how cool is that?</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>In addition to this, Lea admitted to ABC that she takes love very seriously, and she has never been one for casual dating. If Joey were to pop the question during the finale of The Bachelor season 28, she would definitely be on board, leaving fans of The Bachelor franchise with one burning question: Could this duo be in it for the long haul?</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=false>Catch the premiere of&nbsp;The Bachelor&nbsp;season 28 on ABC on January 22 — or the following day via Hulu — to watch the potential love story between Joey Graziadei and Lea Cayanan unfold from the very beginning. This season is sure to be nothing short of spectacular!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0vM6io56qXZa5pr7TZq6hp12ZvKa%2FjKOmnrFdnL%2Bixsiam56hXZy2t7GMrZ%2BeZZaev7TAjKKkqaqVqMCqu81mqairlWLBsHnOp2StoJVir6Kvx56jqKpdqLKiv86nZGtwXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

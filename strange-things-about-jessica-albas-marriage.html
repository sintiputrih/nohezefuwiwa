"It was kind of a love-at-first-sight thing, but I met him when I was dating someone else, so it started off as a friendship," she said. Ruh roh.</p><p>Despite being involved with another man, Alba said she was "attracted to [Warren's] spirit," and, when they finally became an item, he sealed the deal in the corniest way. "He gave me a note and signed it with a dollar sign, because his name is Cash. It just said, 'I really, really like you.' And that was exactly how I felt at the time. Really, really liking him too much ... I was already in love with him."</p><p>This is a cute love story, as long as you're not the guy Alba dumped for Warren!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtlZoR4e9KtqZqml5p6tbTIp56sZZGXvLbAjKOcrKuZmK5urcubmKxlnZa%2Fs7XAoJxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

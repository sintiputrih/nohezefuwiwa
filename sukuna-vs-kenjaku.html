Fans of Gege Akatumi’s Jujutsu Kaisen tend to go crazy if two of the series’ most popular characters square off against one another.</p><p>Fans have long speculated that Kenjaku and Sukuna would eventually fight one other. The cases for both sides are equally compelling. The article delves into the question of which forecast makes the most sense.</p><h2>Who Will Win A Fight Sukuna vs. Kenjaku?</h2><p>With the release of chapter 213 of Jutusu Kaisen, Sukuna is now known to possess Megumi Fushiguro and has 15 fingers. He appears unstoppable, what with his combined 15 fingers and the possibility of using Megumi as a vessel. Nobody can match his level of influence. Now, even Jujutsu Kaisen’s strongest sorcerer, Gojo Satoru, might have trouble with Sukuna.</p><p>At the same time, Kenjaku’s battle with Yuki in chapter 208 demonstrated his newfound strength in Geto’s body. Geto was a top-tier (S) sorcerer with an unparalleled ability to control curses. It has also been demonstrated that Kenjaku is both strategic and well-organized. During the events of the Shibuya Incident, he was successful in locking away the Prison realm’s strongest sorcerer, Gojo of the Jujutsu Kaisen.</p><p>The fact that Kenjaku has been around since the Heian period means that he is also familiar with Sukuna and its might. He also orchestrated Itadori’s conception with the goal of having Itadori eventually cuddle Sukuna. This was shown in chapter 143.</p><p>Still, if we’re talking about a showdown of raw physical might, Sukuna can take Kenjaku down. Sukuna may have trouble defeating Kenjaku because the latter is more clever in his actions and, more significantly, has the ability to transfer his brain to another body.</p><p><strong>You can read more details we have got about Jujutsu Kaisen:</strong></p><h2>Is Kenjaku Capable of Defeating Sukuna?</h2><p>Now that we’ve done the math, the issue is rather clear, and the data backs it up. Although the gap isn’t huge, we can all agree that Sukuna appears to be the more strong of the two and that he would easily defeat Kenjaku in a one-on-one combat. Sukuna is unadulterated might, and the scope of his might is nothing short of phenomenal. Although Kenjaku’s might is undeniable, Sukuna’s raw power, mixed with his talents and expertise, appears to be something that only Gojo can counter.</p><p>While we have established that Kenjaku possesses formidable strength, we have also shown that he frequently resorts to the skills he has “collected,” whereas Sukuna is entirely under his control. Given his immense power and the fact that he does everything on his own (okay, he now uses vessels, but this also applies to the original Sukuna, so don’t think we’ve made a mistake), it’s reasonable to believe that he could defeat Kenjaku.</p><p>Since we don’t know how powerful Kenjaku actually is (we haven’t seen all of his skills), he has a narrow window of opportunity here, but we still don’t think he can beat Sukuna in a battle.</p><p>You can also join us on our <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter account</a> to learn more details relating to upcoming anime and characters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZXxxhI6srKStnpZ6t7%2BMpJynopGgwnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

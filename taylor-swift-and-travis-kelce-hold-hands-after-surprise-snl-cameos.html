The Grammy winner <a href=#>stunned in a black corset top</a> and matching trousers, which she paired with a delicate gold choker, a plaid coat and her signature red lipstick. Kelce, for his part, opted for a cream-colored jacket with blue bird imagery on the front and matching slacks.</p><p class=p1>Earlier that evening, they briefly <a href=#><span class=s1>appeared on the season 49 premiere</span></a> of <i>SNL</i>. Swift introduced her friend (and “Karma” collaborator) <a href=#><strong>Ice Spice</strong></a>’s musical performance, while Kelce acted in a sketch.</p><p class=p1>Kelce joined the <i>SNL </i>cast in a skit about <a href=#>the NFL’s excessive coverage</a> of Swift attending his games.</p><p class=p1>“Knock it off, people tuned in for football, OK?” <a href=#><strong>Kenan Thompson</strong></a>, playing a sports reporter, told his costars after they only wanted to discuss Swift and Kelce’s relationship. “Let’s take a break [and] when we come back, we will get into this heated East Coast rivalry. … We are going to speak with someone, who actually wants to talk football.”</p><p class=p1>The cameras then cut to Kelce — who <a href=#>wore the same outfit</a> as he did on his date with Swift&nbsp; — standing on the sidelines.</p><p class=p1>“Yes, me!” he exclaimed before mouthing the words, “Come on.”</p><p>Swift first caused a frenzy with <a href=#>her attendance at Kelce’s matchup</a> against the Chicago Bears at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, last month. She was spotted chatting with his mother, <a href=#><strong>Donna Kelce</strong></a>, in the athlete’s private suite during the game and enthusiastically cheering when he scored a touchdown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-and-Travis-Kelce-Hold-Hands-After-Surprise-Saturday-Night-Live-Cameos-01.jpg><p>That night, Swift and Travis <a href=#>left the stadium together</a> in his convertible. He reportedly rented out a local restaurant for an after party with Swift and <a href=#>his teammates</a>, where the two were <a href=#>spotted getting cozy</a> as she wrapped her arm around his neck in a photo obtained by TMZ.</p><p>Three days later, Travis addressed <a href=#>Swift’s appearance at the game</a> on his “New Heights” podcast. “Shout-out to Taylor for pulling up,” he said. “That <a href=#>was pretty ballsy</a>.”</p><p>Travis went on to note that his loved ones wholeheartedly approved of Swift. “I just thought it was awesome that everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her. The friends and family. She looked amazing … and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans. We script it all, ladies and gentlemen,” he joked. “It was absolutely electric.”</p><p>He continued: “To see the slow-motion chest bumps, to see the high fives with Mom, to see how Chiefs Kingdom was all excited that she was there … it was definitely a game I’ll remember, that’s for damn sure.”</p><p>Shortly after Swift broke the internet by cheering on Travis in Kansas City, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that the duo “have been on a few dates and Taylor is smitten with him,” adding that the relationship “is not serious and Taylor is having fun right now.” Still, the insider noted that “anything is possible” as <a href=#>they are “getting closer</a> and closer every day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-and-Travis-Kelce-Hold-Hands-After-Surprise-Saturday-Night-Live-Cameos-04.jpg><p>Meanwhile, a second source revealed that Swift and Travis “met shortly after he <a href=#>tried giving her his phone number</a>” on a friendship bracelet when the Eras Tour hit Arrowhead Stadium in July. They are still getting to know each other, though, as the insider said they <a href=#>had “only hung out twice”</a> since connecting.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Swift and Travis’ relationship continued to make headlines as she showed up at his October 1 and October 12 games. A third source later told <i>Us </i>earlier this month that she plans to attend more of Travis’ football games, but not all of them.</p><p class=p2>“Taylor <a href=#><span class=s1>doesn’t want to be a distraction</span></a> to Travis,” the insider told <i>Us</i>. “She knows it’s not easy when she shows up to his games. It’s a spectacle. She wants to support him and strike a balance while, at the same time, not be distracting to the team.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdlruledOrmK%2Bho2K4prjCnmShp5yZeqmtzZ2qZpmWqbKzedKuqamqmaiybr%2FNpWScmZ2avLR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

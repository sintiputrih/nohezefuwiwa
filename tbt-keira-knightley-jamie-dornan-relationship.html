They both appeared in an Asprey campaign that shot in August 2003 and began dating soon after.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them:</strong> Though both parties were incredibly young and new to the spotlight when they met, Dornan and Knightley knew their boundaries with the press. Knightley wouldn’t even confirm that she and Dornan were dating, though when asked she did <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>reportedly tell photographers</a>, “Well, it looks that way, doesn't it?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> I think the answer is obvious. On a grocery run in 2004, Dornan wore the world’s lowest-slung pair of jeans. Knightley, walking beside him, looked similarly of the era in a black jacket, graphic tee, denim miniskirt, boots, and black tights.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Antony Jones/UK Press via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Are you ready for exhibit B?

According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a>, the actor wrote a song for his band Sons of Jim that included lyrics like “I can see your fancy friends trying to steal your innocence … you’re so weak around them.” Nice.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dave Benett/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Years later, Dornan opened up to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Mail on Sunday</a> regarding the “pressure” that came with dating Knightley. “You can feel a bit second-rate and that's what started to happen. It's not like I was bringing the bread to the table — and that can start to affect everything.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He went on to explain that “the man is meant to be the Alpha in the relationship on the money and power front and clearly I was not. You feel you have to be dominant in other areas and that leads to problems.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following year, Dornan refuted the above “alpha” quote, telling the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Evening Standard</a>, “That was taken totally out of context. I didn't mean that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While it’s rumored that Knightley helped Dornan breakthrough with his acting career, or at least lent him the spotlight by association, the Irish star doesn’t see it that way. “Certainly from a professional standpoint I don’t think it has affected anything to do with anything,” he told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Evening Standard</a> in 2012. That said, he was cognizant of the tabloid frenzy that followed his ex at the time.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dave Hogan/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It was a strange environment to find yourself in, being hounded and followed,” he told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Evening Standard</a> in 2014. “It’s really hideous. F***ing hell, [the paparazzi] are cretins. I couldn’t have less respect for those guys. There are so many ways to make a living that don’t involve hiding in bushes opposite houses of 18-year-old girls with a camera in your hand. That’s not making a living, that’s making a choice to be a perverted f***head.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“That scrutiny when you’re older will be easier to take,” he continued, “And I don’t think I’m ever going to be as famous as her.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dornan wed his musician wife Amelia Warner in 2013. They share three daughters: Dulcie, 6, Elva, 4, and Alberta, 18 months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Fall actor has several projects on the horizon, including Kenneth Branagh-directed drama Belfast and a series called Dr. Death.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Knightley also got married in 2013, wedding musician James Righton.

The lawmakers expected pushback from civil liberties organizations but surely did not expect such an act of vandalism.</p><p>During the ramming, Reed live-streamed himself on Facebook via his smartphone. In the video, he made statements regarding the division of church and state and then proclaimed, “Oh my goodness. Freedom!” as he rams his car into the statue:</p><p>Capitol police arrested Reed at the scene just after the collision.</p><p>Believe it or not, this was not the first time that Reed has rammed his car into a Ten Commandments monument at a capitol building. In fact, Reed was booked, but ultimately not charged, in a similar incident three years ago in Oklahoma when he ran over the Ten Commandments monument in front of the capitol in Oklahoma City.</p><p>Following this previous incident, Reed was ultimately admitted to a mental hospital. Reed has made claims that Satan had told him to run over the monument, through his earthly messenger: Gwyneth Paltrow. Reed also made numerous threats towards then-President Barack Obama, and even spit on a photo of him. Reed had been previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p><p>In the wake of this most recent collision in Arkansas, Reed faces a number of charges, <a href=# rel=noopener>NPR reports</a>, including trespassing, defacing an object of public respect, and criminal mischief.</p><p>Despite both this incident and the controversy surrounding the statue, NPR reports that state Senator Jason Rapert, for one, has already announced his intention to have the monument rebuilt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1sc1mmqilnZa7pbnEp6usZaOprrXBxGaYq6ORo8Civw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

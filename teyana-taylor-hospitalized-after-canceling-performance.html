I love y’all! Thank you for being so understanding. Y’all know Petunia don’t miss no shows & most importantly, know I’ve been leaving it all on tha stage for a month straight 1000%. So I am really saddened to have not been able to do the same for you last night. My team & I tried everything down to the very last second to get me out on that stage, but my body simply just gave out, which actually started a few days ago. SHUT DOWN, my body actually low key betrayed me cause ah bitch was tryna get on that stage 🙄 Y’all know I’m with the shits! y’all have seen me with a broken foot and all types of other crazy shit but still got on that stage and bodied it 😩😩 But honestly you have to listen to your body and know when to sit down; or it will definitely sit you down….. in the ER 😑 mine sat my ass down in the ER for sure but I’ve since got the proper fluids and nutrients put back into my body all night/morning & will take the next few off days to continue to recover. However, I promise I will be back to CT rescheduled and better than ever & all tickets will be honored for yesterday’s show!!!! Shoutout to my lovelies @arilennox & @sevyn for holdin it downnnnn! As well as Heather Lowery and the entire @femmeitforward team for their extreme understanding & support.”</p><p>Taylor did not provide additional information about her health but she underwent an emergency biopsy in August after lumps were discovered in her breasts. Fortunately, the tests came back negative.</p><p>“I just want this to be the last time I go through this,” Teyana told E! News at the time. “Cancer runs through my family, so it’s a scary thing both for me and [her husband] Iman.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ35wfZBoaXJnpJrGorrAZquasZykv260zqynoqyRoba7scNmmJ%2Bslad6pK3NnJyloZ6cerGx0Z%2Bmq6WRo7Cmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

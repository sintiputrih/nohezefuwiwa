As television stans already know, the ‘90s was one of the best ages for television, with series like Friends, The Sopranos, and The Simpsons absolutely dominating.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>And seeing as how the common elements surrounding Thanksgiving are family, food, and feel-good moments, it’s certainly no surprise that many of these shows incorporated a few specials inspired by the stomach-growling holiday. So, before you unbutton your pants after that otherworldly Turkey Day feast, let’s take a look at the 12 best ‘90s family sitcom Thanksgiving episodes, ranked.</p><h2 id=h-12-will-grace-homo-for-the-holidays-season-2-episode-7 data-injectable=false>12. Will & Grace — “Homo for the Holidays” (season 2, episode 7)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>You can’t comprise a list of the best ‘90s sitcom episodes without including the ever-popular comedy series Will & Grace. And while the conventional episodes in the show are hysterical enough, then it’s surely no surprise that the out-of-this-world Thanksgiving special would find a home on this list. I</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>n the episode, Jack informs the rest of the gang that his mother Judith is paying a visit for Thanksgiving. The only problem is, Judith has no clue that her son is gay. It’s a gut-busting episode that will certainly get you in a ‘giddy’ mood for the holidays.</p><h2 id=h-11-everybody-loves-raymond-no-fat-season-3-episode-10 data-injectable=false>11. Everybody Loves Raymond — “No Fat” (season 3, episode 10)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>There’s a slew of Everybody Love Raymond Thanksgiving episodes to gush about, but “No Fat” definitely takes the cake. In the season 3 episode, Ray is up in arms after his mother Marie decides to abandon the traditional choice of turkey for Thanksgiving.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>Instead, Marie opts for a Tofurkey (a tofu turkey), which leaves Ray completely speechless. It’s an all-around entertaining episode packed with plenty of laughs. The best part? It’s perfectly appetizing to the vegetarians of the world.</p><h2 id=h-10-family-matters-chick-a-boom-season-8-episode-11 data-injectable=false>10. Family Matters — “Chick-a-Boom” (season 8, episode 11)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>Without a doubt, Family Matters is one of the most underrated sitcoms of any decade, and definitely deserves its moment in the spotlight. Surprisingly, the best Thanksgiving episode came extremely late in the series’ run, occurring during the show’s penultimate season.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>In the chaotic episode, Urkel’s girlfriend Myra volunteers to bake a special chicken-inspired dinner for Carl’s police banquet. Unbeknownst to Myra, she mistakes innocent pepper flakes for fireworks, sprinkling the hazard all over the chicken, which eventually blows up during the banquet. The episode is a gut-busting experience that will leave you laughing even days after watching.</p><h2 id=h-9-that-70s-show-thanksgiving-season-1-episode-9 data-injectable=false>9. That ‘70s Show — “Thanksgiving” (season 1, episode 9)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>Truth be told, the vast majority of episodes from That ‘70s Show are chaotic and unruly — which makes sense, seeing as the ‘70s were definitely an unpredictable time. Nevertheless, the Thanksgiving episode of the series is arguably one of the wildest pieces of television ever broadcast.</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>In the topsy-turvy episode, all hell breaks loose when Laurie brings home a flirtatious friend from college who tries to seduce Eric, much to the obvious displeasure of his girlfriend Donna. It’s an endlessly funny episode that will leave you in tears (and full of stuffing, probably).</p><h2 id=h-8-boy-meets-world-turkey-day-season-4-episode-10 data-injectable=false>8. Boy Meets World – “Turkey Day” (season 4, episode 10)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>I think I speak on behalf of most ’90s kids when I say that Boy Meets World is a nostalgic flashback for us all. Centering around fan-favorites such as Cory, Shawn, and Topanga, the hit series immediately registered with younger folks who were growing up with the aforementioned characters around the same time. And yet, the show still found the time to inject some much-needed humor.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true>But while the Thanksgiving episode is undoubtedly sprinkled with its fair share of comedic bits, the festive special shines a huge light on the importance of family and respecting the individual backgrounds of others. So it’s certainly not just a Thanksgiving episode, but it showcases a significant life lesson.</p><h2 id=h-7-the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-talking-turkey-season-1-episode-12 data-injectable=false>7. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air — “Talking Turkey” (season 1, episode 12)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>Before Will Smith <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was slapping Oscar hosts</a>, he was captivating our attention as the Fresh Prince. From absurd scenarios to intriguing characters, it’s no wonder that The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air proved to be one of the most successful shows of the ‘90s — and its Thanksgiving episode is arguably the craziest experience.</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>In the Turkey Day special, Will’s mom Viola visits the Banks’ house for the holiday, although she has trouble coming to terms with the fact that Will is happy and healthy in a new home. In the end, the episode proves to be a heartwarming encounter that pushes forward the importance of family.</p><h2 id=h-6-seinfeld-the-mom-pop-store-season-6-episode-8 data-injectable=false>6. Seinfeld — “The Mom & Pop Store” (season 6, episode 8)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>It would be almost criminal to gather a list of the best ‘90s Thanksgiving specials without including the ever-popular phenomenon known as Seinfeld. Labeled as one of the hottest shows of the ‘90s, “The Mom & Pop Store” will easily go down in history as one of the best Thanksgiving episodes on television.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>The episode’s premise centers around the core friends’ group attending a Thanksgiving party while a chaotic Thanksgiving day parade fiasco presents most of the special’s comedic shine. With Seinfeld being recognized as a ‘90s staple, it only makes sense that its Thanksgiving episode would go over the top with hilarity.</p><h2 id=h-5-cheers-thanksgiving-orphans-season-5-episode-9 data-injectable=false>5. Cheers – “Thanksgiving Orphans” (season 5, episode 9)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>It’s simply too difficult to deny that a singular soul out there wasn’t completely fascinated with Cheers back during the show’s original run. Of course, with a stacked pile of memorable episodes as tall as the Empire State Building, it makes perfect sense as to why even Cheers‘ re-runs are higher rated than some basic TV series now.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>But in the discussion of the show’s antique episodes, we have to include one of the funniest Thanksgiving specials in television history. With the episode centering around the gang coming together to have a Thanksgiving potluck, true chaos certainly ensues when a messy food fight breaks out in the middle of dinner. And yes, technically this episode is from the late ’80s, but it’s still a classic.</p><h2 id=h-4-frasier-a-lilith-thanksgiving-season-4-episode-7 data-injectable=false>4. Frasier — “A Lilith Thanksgiving” (season 4, episode 7)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>You’d be hard-pressed to find someone that would argue with the glaring fact that Frasier is one of the most underrated television gems from the soarin’ ‘90s. And, truth be told, it would be an understatement to say that Frasier boasted some of the very best holiday specials on TV.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>In “A Lilith Thanksgiving,” Frasier’s ex-wife Lilith requests his presence to help their son get accepted into a prestigious university. Along the way, the show’s leading characters engage in a rambunctious adventure full of humor, family, and lighthearted fun. Plus, any episode featuring Niles is an episode worthy of a watch.</p><h2 id=h-3-the-simpsons-bart-vs-thanksgiving-season-2-episode-7 data-injectable=false>3. The Simpsons — “Bart vs. Thanksgiving” (season 2, episode 7)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>As one of the most celebrated animated sitcoms in the history of television, it comes as no surprise that The Simpsons would land directly near the top of this list. In arguably one of the best episodes of the entire show, an altercation between Bart and Lisa results in Bart refusing to apologize and running away from home.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>However, when Bart eventually overhears his sister crying, he decides to apologize for his mistakes and the family reconciles. It’s an oddly touching episode in a series with an abundance of comedy, but it definitely rings in as one of the best of the ‘90s.</p><h2 id=h-2-full-house-the-miracle-of-thanksgiving-season-1-episode-9 data-injectable=false>2. Full House — “The Miracle of Thanksgiving” (season 1, episode 9)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>One of the most obvious elements in the Full House ethos is the importance of family, which is often echoed through plot points surrounding the beloved Tanner clan. And while the majority of the show’s episodes inhabit a particular touch of emotion, the Thanksgiving episode is undoubtedly a roller-coaster ride of affection.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>In the episode, the gang must endure their first Thanksgiving without Danny’s wife Pam, who died in a car accident prior to the show’s pilot episode. Despite the characters’ grieving, a plethora of humorous moments occur between the show’s leading cast, which results in a heartwarming episode that deserves a watch this holiday season.</p><h2 id=h-1-friends-the-one-with-all-the-thanksgivings-season-5-episode-8 data-injectable=false>1. Friends — “The One With All The Thanksgivings” (season 5, episode 8)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>Interestingly enough, when the topic of Friends is brought up at Thanksgiving, you’ll find that the series divides your relatives in half — with the consensus that either you love the show or you hate it, depending on personal taste. Nevertheless, it’s hard to discount Friends as one of the hottest television shows of the ‘90s, with an array of Thanksgiving episodes that undoubtedly added to the show’s general likability.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=false>In this Thanksgiving special, the “Friends” sat around and reminisced on their wildest Thanksgiving memories — many of which included the characters at a much younger, more impressionable age. It’s a wildly entertaining episode, even if you’re not a fan of the show, that leaves you absolutely in stitches. And with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the unfortunate passing</a> of star Matthew Perry recently, this feels like the necessary time to try and have a laugh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmmZ6rpGKGcb%2BMn5imoZyuerS105ympmWkna6vt9KgoK%2Bhnpx6przIrKadnaNiv6K6yp6baA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

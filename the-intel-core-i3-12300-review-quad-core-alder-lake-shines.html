The aim is to give users the largest core count – with many applications and games now benefiting from various multi-core optimizations&nbsp;– all for the best possible price. The other element of this fight has come down to IPC performance, with Intel and AMD flip-flopping for the top spot on its flagship desktop processors each time they both launch a new processor. Due to AMD's Zen architectures, Intel has been on the ropes in both performance and value for a while. Intel&nbsp;has been forced to push its innovation and boundaries to try and maintain what it previously had; a majority market share.</p><p>As we highlighted in our launch day <a href=#>Core i9-12900K review</a>, Intel's new Alder Lake architecture brings new improvements and refinements to the table. This includes the two types of core, P-cores for performance and E-cores for efficiency/multi-threading. The P-cores are based on Intel's Golden Cove architecture,&nbsp;with the aim of offering applications performance when it needs it. The E-cores, or efficiency cores as Intel depicts them, are lower power, and one E-core&nbsp;equates to roughly 50-60% of the performance of one P-Core.&nbsp;</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/17231/Intel%20Core%20i3-12300%20CPU%20Feature_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Focusing on Intel's Core i3-12300, it is the top SKU in its Core i3 lineup, with four P-cores, a base frequency of 3.5 GHz, and a turbo frequency of 4.4 GHz. In terms of power consumption, Intel has rated the i3-12300 at base frequencies with a&nbsp;TDP of 60 W and a 89 W TDP when at turbo clock speeds.</p><p>Intel's interpretation of turbo on Alder Lake, which is essential from a power draw perspective, is 'infinite turbo.' This means the processor will try and use as much turbo as and when it can. Fundamentally from a performance perspective, this is good as it will hit turbo clock speeds more frequently, but ultimately, it makes power consumption particularly variable, depending on the workload.</p><h3>Intel Core i3-12300: Performance Analysis</h3><p>It's all good and well having 16-core processors in a desktop platform, but ultimately, these typically cost upwards of $600. So what about CPUs for the more budget-conscious? Well, up until the launch of Intel's 12th Gen Core processors, AMD's Ryzen 5000 series had been at top of IPC, multi-threaded performance, and in a lot of scenarios, game performance and overall value too. One of AMD's most cost-effective processors remains the Ryzen 5 5600X, with six cores and competitive clock speeds at a reasonable price of $229.</p><p>In budget CPU space, things have now changed with both of Intel's Core i3 and i5 series slotting into that sub $300 market segment, with the Core i3 series significantly undercutting the 5600X in terms of price. In practice, Intel has the sub-$200 market entirely to itself right now, since AMD doesn't have access to the manufacturing capacity needed to address that market (and thus compete directly with the i3-12300).</p><p>Another factor that comes into play is Alder Lake's&nbsp;ability to support both DDR5 and DDR4 memory. We&nbsp;tested the Core i3-12300 with Windows 11 and DDR5-4800 CL40 memory for our Bench database data for comparative purposes. We did run tests with DDR5 4800 CL40 against DDR4-3200 CL22 on the Core i3-12300 on page 3, but the overall performance swing isn't as big as users might think, at least not in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>Let's take a look at some of the results and digest how the Intel Core i3-12300 stacks up against the competition:</p><p><img alt="(4-7a) CineBench R23 Single Thread" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph17231/127759.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Looking at single-threaded performance in Cinebench R23, the Core i3-12300 and the four Golden Cove P-cores show dominance over previous generations of Intel's architecture, as well as AMD's Zen 3 cores. This typically changes each time AMD or Intel releases a new desktop architecture, and right now, Intel's 12th gen Core has the single-threaded crown.</p><p><img alt="(4-7b) CineBench R23 Multi-Thread" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph17231/127760.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In the multi-threaded section of Cinebench R23, this is where the cores or lack thereof come into play. Both&nbsp;AMD's Zen 3 6-core and 8-core processors have a considerable advantage in applications that can utilize all of the cores and threads available. Comparing DDR5 to DDR4 on the i3-12300, the DDR5-4800 CL40 performed around 8% better than DDR4-3200 CL22 in Cinebench R23's multi-threaded test.</p><p>For a more classic comparison, we also have the Core i7-2600K, which released over 10 years ago, was one of the most popular quad core chips ever produced. Comparing it directly to the Core i3-12300, the (much) newer i3 performs 2.3x better in terms of multi-threaded performance.</p><p><span>The only real competitor in the 4C/8T segment from AMD with Zen 3 cores,&nbsp;<span>is the Ryzen 3 5300G APU. In our computational benchmarks, the Core i3-12300 has a consistent and distinct advantage in both single-thread and multi-threaded performance. So even if AMD could produce those chips in retail volumes, at this point they'd come in behind Intel's top quad.</span></span></p><p>Looking at other generational differences to AMD's Ryzen 3000 and 1000 series chips, the Core i3-12300 comfortably beats the Zen-based Ryzen 5 1600 (6C/12T)&nbsp;processor. For reference, it is only 12.4% slower than the Zen 2 based Ryzen 5 3600X (6C/12T)&nbsp;processor in Cinebench R23 multi-threaded performance.</p><p><img alt="(k-7) Grand Theft Auto V - 1080p Max - Average FPS" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph17231/127765.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In our GTA V testing at 1080p at max settings with an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti, the Core i3-12300 is highly competitive with AMD's Ryzen 5000&nbsp;six and eight-core models. This includes Intel's 11th generation processors, despite a lower core and thread count. The difference between DDR5 and DDR4 with the Core i3-12300 shows that using the platform with DDR5 memory was around 6% better in average frame rates over DDR4 when using Alder Lake's JEDEC memory settings.</p><p>While gaming is subjective as different game engines are optimized differently for CPU core count, performance in GPU intensive titles shows the Core i3-12300 in a favorable light, thus making it competitive for 1080p gaming.</p><p><img alt="(b-7) Civilization VI - 1080p Max - Average FPS" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph17231/127767.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Looking at our Civilization VI benchmark performance at 1080p max settings, we see the limitations of where having a higher core count makes a substantial difference. Despite the 6C/12T and 8C/16T processors showing dominance, it's worth noting that the Core i3-12300 is still comfortably performing above 60 fps in average frame rates, with the 95th percentile frame rates also hovering close to 60 fps.</p><p>Touching on DDR5 versus DDR4 with the i3-12300 and in a more CPU favorable test such as Civilization VI, the DDR5 configuration performed 3.7% better in terms of average frame rates. Not a lot of difference considering the current price premium DDR5 has attached at the moment, but it's still an improvement nonetheless.</p><p>A broader selection&nbsp;of our CPU game testing results, including at other resolutions, can be found in our benchmark database: <a href=#>www.anandtech.com/bench</a>. All gaming tests were with an RTX 2080 Ti for comparative purposes.</p><h3>Intel Core i3-12300: Is Four Cores Enough in 2022?</h3><p>The primary use case for Intel's Core i3 series includes lower-powered desktops, where tasks such as video rendering, encoding, and other content-creation tasks either aren't the target market, or are not the biggest use case for the market. As we've seen throughout our testing, the Intel Core i3-12300 is a fantastic processor for gamers on a budget, even with fewer cores than the competition, such as the Ryzen 5 5600 ($229), which is 6C/12T. You could say that the R5 5600X isn't really a competitor due to the price, but Intel is slotting in its Core i3 series well below AMD Ryzen 5000's entry point, and this makes things interesting.</p><table border=0 width=100%><tbody readability=1><tr class=tgrey readability=2><td colspan=11>Intel Core i5 & i3 Processor Specifications (12th Gen Alder Lake)</td></tr><tr class=tlblue><td>AnandTech</td><td>Cores<br>P+E</td><td>P-Core<br>Base</td><td>P-Core<br>Turbo</td><td>E-Core<br>Base</td><td>E-Core<br>Turbo</td><td>L3<br>MB</td><td>IGP</td><td>Base<br>W</td><td>Turbo<br>W</td><td>Price<br>$1ku</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-12600K</td><td>6+4</td><td>3700</td><td>4900</td><td>2800</td><td>3600</td><td>20</td><td>770</td><td>125</td><td>150</td><td>$289</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey><span>i5-12600KF</span></td><td>6+4</td><td>3700</td><td>4900</td><td>2800</td><td>3600</td><td>20</td><td>-</td><td>125</td><td>150</td><td>$264</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-12600</td><td>6+0</td><td>3300</td><td>4800</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>18</td><td>770</td><td>65</td><td>117</td><td>$223</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-12600T</td><td>6+0</td><td>2100</td><td>4600</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>18</td><td>770</td><td>35</td><td>74</td><td>$223</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-12500</td><td>6+0</td><td>3000</td><td>4600</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>18</td><td>770</td><td>65</td><td>117</td><td>$202</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-12500T</td><td>6+0</td><td>2000</td><td>4400</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>18</td><td>770</td><td>35</td><td>74</td><td>$202</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-12400</td><td>6+0</td><td>2500</td><td>4400</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>18</td><td>730</td><td>65</td><td>117</td><td>$192</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-12400F</td><td>6+0</td><td>2500</td><td>4400</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>18</td><td>-</td><td>65</td><td>117</td><td>$167</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-12400T</td><td>6+0</td><td>1800</td><td>4200</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>18</td><td>730</td><td>35</td><td>74</td><td>$192</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey colspan=11>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey><strong>i3-12300</strong></td><td><strong>4+0</strong></td><td><strong>3500</strong></td><td><strong>4400</strong></td><td><strong>-</strong></td><td><strong>-</strong></td><td><strong>12</strong></td><td><strong>730</strong></td><td><strong>60</strong></td><td><strong>89</strong></td><td><strong>$143</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i3-12300T</td><td>4+0</td><td>2300</td><td>4200</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>12</td><td>730</td><td>35</td><td>69</td><td>$143</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i3-12100</td><td>4+0</td><td>3300</td><td>4300</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>12</td><td>730</td><td>60</td><td>89</td><td>$122</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i3-12100F</td><td>4+0</td><td>3300</td><td>4300</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>12</td><td>-</td><td>58</td><td>89</td><td>$97</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i3-12100T</td><td>4+0</td><td>2200</td><td>4100</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>12</td><td>730</td><td>35</td><td>69</td><td>$122</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Looking above at Intel's 12th generation Core i5 and i3 processor stack, only the top two Core i5 models feature E-cores, the Core i5-12600K and Core i5-12600KF. Nothing below these in the stack comes with E-cores, and instead, rely on the fully-fledged P-cores (Golden Cove), with 6 cores for all the Core i5s and 4 cores for the Core i3 models.</p><p>Comparing the Core i3-12300 (4C/8T) to other 4C/8T and&nbsp;6C/12T SKUs&nbsp;such as the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X (6C/12T), the Core i3 is very competitive overall, but it does show its limitations in multi-thread applications and scenarios. As users would generally expect to be the case, the Core i3-12300 is Intel's most potent quad-core processor thus far. This isn't a surprise as the i3-12300 benefits from the Intel 7 manufacturing process, as well as&nbsp;generational increases to IPC performance, base, and turbo frequencies.</p><p>The decision&nbsp;on whether or not it's worth buying the Core i3-12300 over hex-core chips like the Ryzen 5 3600X or the Core i5-12600K comes down to the use case. Users planning on doing any form of rendering, encoding, or running multi-core optimized workloads will benefit from the extra cores and threads. Still, there's not that much difference between the Core i3-12300 and Ryzen 5 3600X in regards to gaming, or in other workloads that can't fill out more than 4 cores.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/17231/Intel%20Core%20i3-12300%20Quad%20Core%20Processor_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In gaming at 1080p and single-threaded applications, the Core i3-12300 excels and stakes its claim as a fantastic option for users on a budget. Looking further down the Alder Lake Core i3 stack, the Core i3-12100 ($122) could be the best value of the bunch, with a base frequency of 3.3 GHz and a turbo frequency of 4.3 GHz; just 100 MHz slower than the i3-12300. The onus is now on AMD to bring something competitive in the sub-$200 segment of the market, as right now, Intel holds all the marbles.</p><p>With an MSRP of $143, it's clear that the Intel Core i3-12300 represents excellent value for money in a current market where users are struggling to find value in components. It is clear Alder Lake has been a success for Intel, and the Core i3-12300 offers leading-edge quad-core performance on desktop for an equally great price.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH54fpJqZq2glWK2r8DEpWScp6Kaeqp%2FjGppbGhgYr%2BmwsiermappZaxbq%2FOq5xmmZyZsrN5y5qinmWjnbavsdJocA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

We will miss you greeting us at the door, nudging our hand to pet you, jumping on our freshly made bed throwing the pillows off and laying on it staking your claim, seeing you in your spot, you never letting us win a game of tug, always protecting us, your warmth, your sweetness, your big kisses.</p><p>Even though you are gone your memory lives on and the love we have in our hearts will never go away. We love you. Rest in piece our sweet beautiful Mocha.</p><p>Our thoughts are with Miz and Maryse during this time. No cause of death was mentioned, but Mocha lived an incredible life with the It Family. Now they will have to carry on without her. This is a very sad day and we feel for them because it’s never easy losing a pet.</p><p><strong>Can you relate to what The Miz is going through?

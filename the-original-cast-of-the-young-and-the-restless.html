Katherine was never an original character. She was brought on in Nov. 1973–8 months after the show premiered. Jill Foster (Abbott) is an original character–she’s been on since day 1 (though did not appear in the premiere/first episode).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvToZxmp6KetKq6wKVknJmjqXqwsoytn55lqaTCr7OMmqWdZaSdsm6%2BxKyrpZ2jqHxyfpZuZ20%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

After graduating in 1982, he opened his first workshop based in Wootton-by-Woodstock.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c07de07e0618-chris-shaw-repair-shop.jpg><p id=eqSavFM1hMq data-wc=44>On how he got into bookbinding, Chris told the BBC: "<strong>I got into it quite randomly, I was on a building site at 17</strong>, I didn't like the place I was living, and I always loved books, so I went to Guildford Technical College.&nbsp;</p><p id=eVn4saltgXA data-wc=44>"It was a real stroke of luck as it just clicked," he continued. "The nice thing about bookbinding is it's really engrossing, it's therapeutic and mindful. The first thing I learnt was how to make a book before I could learn to repair it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f663de4aba75-repair-windrush.jpg><p id=e-luGVIUwbN data-wc=14>In 1993, Chris moved his workshop to Brackley in Northamptonshire, where he now lives.&nbsp;</p><p id=edsTZlFc8B_ data-wc=46>The bookbinder has won numerous accolades for his work in the Designer Bookbinders Annual Competition, including The Hewits Prize and The Ted Womersley Award. He's also a four-time Elizabeth Greenhill Award winner and was one of the 25 winners of the 2017 Designer Bookbinder International Competition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/352afd108756-chris-repair-shop-wire-fox-dog.jpg><p id=eSVi9Xl1xlb data-wc=77>Chris was cast in The Repair Shop after being approached by the show's producers. "I got an email asking me to do a casting video and I thought it's television, visuals are important, so I'll wear what I normally wear - I like hats, so I put my hat on and my pipe," he revealed. "I wasn't sure about what to do, but I can talk about books so I gave it a go...and here we are."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">MORE REPAIR SHOP STARS</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The Repair Shop stars' jobs away from the show" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/cb6dfef61cc1-repair-shop-experts.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The Repair Shop stars' jobs away from the show" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The Repair Shop stars' jobs away from the show</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Inside Will Kirk's sweet off-screen relationships with The Repair Shop co-stars" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f3e5ce485661-will-kirk-bbc.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Inside Will Kirk's sweet off-screen relationships with The Repair Shop co-stars" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Inside Will Kirk's sweet off-screen relationships with The Repair Shop co-stars</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The Repair Shop star Mark Stuckey's life away from show: from wife to home tragedy" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/973d5d66e699-mark-stuckey-bbc.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The Repair Shop star Mark Stuckey's life away from show: from wife to home tragedy" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The Repair Shop star Mark Stuckey's life away from show: from wife to home tragedy</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Meet The Repair Shop stars' children: Jay Blades, Will Kirk & more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/e9b5a0af22e5-the-repair-shop-cast-and-their-children.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Meet The Repair Shop stars' children: Jay Blades, Will Kirk & more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Meet The Repair Shop stars' children: Jay Blades, Will Kirk & more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 dir=ltr>Chris's home life away from the show</h2><p id=eann4Ohy2b6 data-wc=29>When he's not breathing new life into old and tired books in the Repair Shop barn, Chris can be found at home in Brackley, where he runs his workshop.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f65086a7c5ac-chris-repair-shop-dog.jpg><p id=eBzl0iA-QA5 data-wc=45>While not much is known about Chris's home life, he often shares photos and videos of his beloved dogs, Fox Terrier Keith and Collie George on social media.

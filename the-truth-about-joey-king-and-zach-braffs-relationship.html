There's no doubt Braff has a special place in Joey's heart and vice versa. Both of them have enjoyed great career success. Let's take a look at their private lives.</p><h2 id=joey-king-supports-zach-braff-relationship-with-florence-pugh>Joey King Supports Zach Braff Relationship With Florence Pugh</h2><p>Zach Braff is dating Black Widow star, Florence Pugh. In a video posted to Instagram, the Little Women actress reacts to receiving what she describes as offensive and <a href=#>hateful comments</a> about the <a href=#>Scrubs actor</a> and their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">21-year age difference</a>. Within eight minutes of publicly paying tribute to the actor on his birthday, Pugh says 70% of the comments were hurling abuse. In addition, the British actress explains that she was forced to turn off comments on her account.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Joey King's Tattoos</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Florence and Zach have been romantically linked since April 2019. Nevertheless, the couple has been relatively private about their relationship except for the occasional date night or Instagram display of public affection.</p><p>In her video post, Pugh addresses critics, telling them to unfollow her if they're not willing to respect her and Zach's privacy. Florence's celebrity followers applauded her stance, with Ariana Grande commenting, "Oh, I love and appreciate you so much."</p><p>Joey King showed her support, writing, "You are simply the coolest." Also, model Stefania Ferrario commented, "My partner is 22 years my senior, and we have been together almost seven years. Love is a diverse, beautiful thing, and I hope more people open their minds up a little more."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joey-king-breakup-with-her-kissing-booth-co-star>Joey King Breakup With Her Kissing Booth Co-Star</h2><p>Joey King and Jacob Elordi dated for over a year before they split in 2018. They were dating around the time when they filmed The Kissing Booth 1, but now for the sequel of their Netflix movie, they are not together.</p><p>The Kissing Booth follows the story of a teenage girl, Elle, played by Joey, whose budding romance with a high school senior, Noah, played by Jacob, puts her lifelong friendship with Noah's younger brother in jeopardy. The film is based on a book with the same name by Beth Reekles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Joey and Jacob took Elle and Noah's love offscreen, things didn't work out. Recently, Joey opened up about working with her ex on the Toast News Network podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MOOD With Lauren Elizabeth</a>. She started off by saying, "I know what everyone wants to know, of course. It was crazy. It was a wild experience. But honestly, it was a really beautiful time. Because I learned a lot about myself and I grew as an actor. I grew as a person on this."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scrubs: 10 Things We Love About Zach Braff & Donald Faison’s Bromance</a></span></p><p>So while it may not have been an ideal situation, it was worth it for Joey for the sake of the movie. And while Joey seems to be handling this situation like a champ, many fans thought Jacob looked miserable in The Kissing Booth trailer. People weren't even sure if Jacob would appear in the sequel for a while because he didn't appear in the original announcement. Plus, the first movie ended with his character heading off to Harvard, so viewers had a 50/50 chance of him either reappearing or being written off. However, he returned for the sequel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-kissing-booth-3>The Kissing Booth 3</h2><p>The third film is finally here. Let's take a look at everything Joey just told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> about the series ending and her connection to her character Elle. The actress looked back on the first moment she read the script for The Kissing Booth and felt an immediate kinship with Elle Evans. She said, "I always felt very connected to Elle. I remember receiving the script for the first movie. I called my team, and I said, 'When can I audition for this? I want this so bad.'"</p><p>Once Joey stepped into the role of Elle, she immediately felt how similar they were. The star explained, "Her vibe, her sense of humor; I felt very in tune with it. And same thing goes for the second and third movie, if not more so— I went through a lot of important life moments in her shoes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She discussed how she's changed a lot as a person and learned so much since playing Elle at only 17 years old.</p><p>Although Joey and Zach Braff are busy with their filming schedules, it seems like there are always there for each other. As proof of it, the actor dedicated a lovely message on his Instagram to Joe, writing: "Netflix says @joeyking's movie The Kissing Booth is one of the most-watched movies in the world. Now that y'all finally discovered my Lil muse go watch her steal my movie Wish I Was Here. Here she is before and after shaving her head on camera. #proudpapa."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lorde Goes Blonde And Twitter Accuses Her Of Being A ‘Billie Eilish Wannabe’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6q7vEsmSkoZ6ceqK6w2axmpuYYq%2BzrcWfqmaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBifA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Not a good look.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">When asked what she apparently saw at the back of the plane to cause the caught-on-camera meltdown, Gomas said: “I literally did not see anything.” <span class=credit>knuckelslawncare/Tiktok</span></figure><p>When asked what the dispute was about, she declined to provide details other than saying she had given up her aisle seat because “as you heard me saying, I’m only 5-2, in my little bratty-ass voice.”</p><p>“There was really bad energy and I don’t want to get into all the details in all of that … as you know, it’s ongoing,” Gomas said.</p><p>But she added that it would have been “way cooler” if she had actually seen something mysterious.</p><p>Gomas said she didn’t leave her home for four weeks after her meltdown, which led to her being kicked off the plane.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Gomas has asked people to not judge her after the outburst. <span class=credit>Texas Airport Dept of Public Safety</span></figure><p>She has insisted she was justified in delaying the flight for hours.</p><p>“I was distressed and I was getting off the plane, no matter what, I just probably didn’t need to make the scene that I made,” she said previously.</p><p>Gomas accused a relative of stealing her AirPods, according to police records reviewed by The Post.</p><p>She yelled she was “getting the f–k off” the plane, as she stormed up and down the aisle of the Fort Worth-to-Orlando flight.</p><p>“You can sit on this plane and you can f–king die with them or not. I’m not going to,” the combative woman told fellow passengers.</p><p>She later refused to leave the boarding area,&nbsp;assaulted a bystander&nbsp;in the terminal, swore at police, and again insisted that the flight would not make it to Florida, without elaborating on the threat.</p><p>Bodycam footage showed that police thought Gomas was drunk or on drugs, but she was never tested for public intoxication and was only verbally cited for criminal trespassing.</p><p>Gomas&nbsp;<a href=#>offered an apology&nbsp;</a>for her outburst without explanation in a video published first by TMZ — then posted on social media — in which she also promoted a new website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmaWtfo7K4v46toJ%2BekaPGbrPOppisZZaeu6K4y7Jkq52mmq6tv4ywn5qsXZiutr%2FEnWShnaJiw6q%2BwKVkp6ekYr%2BmrctmmKadop6worqMmqCrpJmjsrR5zJ6jrZyfrLtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

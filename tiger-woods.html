He had a remarkable career.</p><p>Earl Woods, his father, wrote that Tiger beat him for the first time when he was 11 years old, despite Earl’s best efforts. From that point on, he was consistently defeated by Woods. At the tender age of 12, he became the first player to shoot a round of 70 on a professional golf course.</p><p>It was during the 1989 Big I that he made his collegiate debut as a 13-year-old amateur. In the last round, he was partnered with a relatively unknown player, John Daly.</p><p>Those that qualified for the event were paired with a professional for each group. To win by a single shot, Daly birdied the final three holes.

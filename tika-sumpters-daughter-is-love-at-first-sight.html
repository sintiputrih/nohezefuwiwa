Tika was hesitant to share news of her expectancy with the world because of cyber bullies."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They said, ‘You did it the way you wanted to do it. You’re an inspiration.'”</p><p>Sumpter’s assumptions about cruelty online proved true when news spread that the father of her child was white. Some critics went to the extent of accusing Tika of letting “all that melanin [go] down the drain.”</p><p>Although the scrutiny was great, Tika managed to respond with grace. “Enjoy and create the life you want to live,” she wrote on Instagram. “Don’t look to the left or the right. Look forward, be grateful and smile a lot. Those who hate just need a big hug and encouragement to live their best life. Pray for them. I do.”</p><p>Sumpter also plans to teach her daughter the power of love and forgiveness. “There’s so much I want to teach my daughter, including humility, grace, forgiveness, and understanding,” she told Fit Pregnancy prior to giving birth. “I want her to know her worth and that it’s okay to walk into a room and say, ‘Yes, I’m smart and amazing and I have ideas.’ I want to teach her how to be a boss.”</p><p>Ella-Loren is Tika Sumpter and Nicholas James’ first child together. She was born on October 8, 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kG9mamlfZoRwwMikmGarpaK9tbHRrGSdmaWctbWx0WagrGWcpMOmecCtZJ%2BhoqjBbr%2FIoJ%2BtZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The all-new map has been a joy to explore after <a href=#>The End of Chapter 2 event</a> flipped the entire Fortnite island over.</p><p>With some all-new map locations for players to enjoy, the change of pace in Chapter 3 has been well-received by Epic Games' fanbase. A new development highlighted by popular Fortnite leakers suggests the return of an original Fortnite drop from Chapter 1 of the battle royale.</p><p>Here's all the latest news as it appears Tilted Towers is returning to Fortnite for some classic battle royale fun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/pO1HOrsmw85tMhH9gys3zZLqevPZ_Z95tGkLUdc568g/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9Gb3J0bml0ZS9Gb3J0bml0ZUNoYXB0ZXIzVGlsdGVkVG93ZXJzLmpwZw><h2>When is Tilted Towers returning to Fortnite?</h2><p>Tilted Towers first debuted in Fortnite all the way back in Chapter 1 Season 2 of the battle royale. The location was always a wildly popular drop as it contained the most rooms, item chests, windows, and high-rise buildings.</p><p>A giant meteor strike hit the center of the named location in Chapter 1 Season 4, creating a crater in the middle of the city. While the buildings were somewhat restored over the storyline, they were never returned to the original Tilted Towers status.</p><p>After hints suggested the fan-favourite location could be back in <a href=#>Chapter 3</a>, a snow-covered location began to resemble the familiar towers. Now according to a recent tweet from popular and trusted Fortnite leaker, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>, the return of Tilted Towers could come as soon as Tuesday, 17th January 2022.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>TILTED TOWERS COMING TOMORROW!!</p><p>Epic Posted this on Facebook & Twitter: "One more day üèôÔ∏è" <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aOV2AX79xv</a></p>‚Äî HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href=#>January 17, 2022</a><h2>Tilted Towers map location - Chapter 3 Season 1</h2><p>While Tilted Towers will be returning for another stint in Fortnite, it won't be the same map location. The start of Chapter 3 saw the entire Fortnite island flip over, so everything has been different since then.</p><p>While the towers are mostly covered in snow, we are currently able to see the tips of the new Tilted Towers, and it's right in the middle of the island. Famous for being the most hotly-contested drop point, it looks like Tilted Towers will be back to a murderer's row.</p><p>Here's a map highlighting the exact point of where Tilted Towers will be located in Chapter 3 Season 1 of Fortnite.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/6yYr8laDY2NhRXOzpqTaUYpp0V4CQQAaBh_IDe9S-bo/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9Gb3J0bml0ZS9Gb3J0bml0ZUNoYXB0ZXIzVGlsdGVkVG93ZXJzTWFwTG9jYXRpb24uanBn><p>Located conveniently in the middle of Camp Cuddle, Coney Crossroads, Greasy Grove, and Rocky Reels, this seems like a very plausible spot to put the new Tilted Towers. As mentioned it's almost dead-center of the map, and it will surely be filled with players ready to take you out, so be ready for action as soon as you drop.</p><p>Featured image courtesy of Epic Games.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXNsWWtrl%2Bau3Cyzqurp6Gkmny1tcutnJ1lpKTEpr7SZqmerKWnu6q6xmarqGWWpL%2B1usitnGabmJa9tbHRZmpmq5WWwLC6jGo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

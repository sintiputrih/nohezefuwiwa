“Jay-Z for sure. He gets busy. Ain’t no need to go into intricate detail, but overall, his body of work is official and he gets busy. Can’t front on that,” he said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Speaking with <a href=#>Vlad TV</a>, he named <a href=#>Notorious B.I.G.</a>, <a href=#>Steele</a>, <a href=#>Brother J</a>, Ike Eyes and <a href=#>Jay-Z</a>.</p><p>“Jay-Z for sure. He gets busy. Ain’t no need to go into intricate detail, but overall, his body of work is official and he gets busy. Can’t front on that,” he said. “Big, of course. I remember openieng up shows for Big. I’d be like, ‘Yeah, we warmed it up for you, son.’ And he’d be like, ‘Warmed it up? I don’t even want to go out there!’ But Big. Me and Big was cool. We had a little discrepancy between my crew and they crew, but for the most part, I love Big.”</p><p>He also bigged up his <a href=#>Duck Down Records</a> brethren. “Steele, from <a href=#>Smif-N-Wessun</a>. He was a big influence on all of us. He was the first one rhyming. He was doing it in high school. Actually Steele was the first one out of <a href=#>Boot Camp</a> to do it. But <a href=#>Buckshot</a> won a contest and got a deal first, and they automatically pulled Steele and Tek in, pulled me and Rock in.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Sean Mandela rounded out the list with two relatively underappreciated MCs. “Brother J. I don’t know why people sleep on Brother J. Because of his content? If he was rhyming anything else, he would be in everybody’s top 10. He had a presence and his raps were serious. Maybe because it was so X-Clan-ish, maybe some people ain’t really… But I’m a big Brother J fan. He can rap his ass off. Voice, the cadence, the flow… Brother J,” he said. “Ike Eyes. He’s not a popular rapper. Y’all don’t know him. He’s my friend. I listen to Ike and go ‘Ah, gimme my pen! I need to write this down.’”</p><p></p><p class=question><strong>RELATED:</strong><a href=#>Sean Price On Why He Doesn’t Like Female Rappers Except MC Lyte & Rah Digga</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZhaoN4fo6toK2klWPApq3NZqeroZOaeq%2BtzJ6qZqCZqHq1u89mnaKulWKzosLOq6CtnV2Xv7C7yqWwp2Wilr2xsdGs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

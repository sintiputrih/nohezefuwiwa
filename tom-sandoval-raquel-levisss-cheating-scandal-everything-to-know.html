The news stunned Pump Rules fans <a href=#>and stars alike</a>, particularly in the wake of Raquel’s <a href=#>brief romance</a> with <a href=#><strong>Tom Schwartz</strong></a>.</p><p>A source exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> that Sandoval’s infidelity was just the tip of the iceberg when it came to his and Ariana’s relationship problems. “They were having problems for a while,” the insider shared, adding that things “only came to a breaking point” the day before the pair’s split was announced.</p><p>Ariana joined the cast of Pump Rules in November 2013, and a few months later, she and Sandoval announced they were dating during the show’s season two reunion <a href=#>in February 2014</a>. Despite their long-standing relationship, the restauranteur exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> in December 2018 that he and the model would “probably never” get engaged. Ariana echoed her boyfriend’s words during the interview, adding, “It’s not on the agenda for us.”</p><p>At the time, Sandoval noted that they were more focused on buying a home together, stating, “To me, we’d rather put our money in that investment than, to us, marriage or a wedding and all that, an expensive ring.”</p><p>The couple gave Us another relationship update at BravoCon <a href=#>in October 2022</a>. “We’re great. We’re doing really good,” Sandoval shared, after which Ariana addressed false rumors of them calling it quits online.</p><p>“I look at all those blind items [online] and things like that. I’m into it, so I totally get it,” the Fancy AF Cocktails — which she cowrote with her now-ex — author told Us. “If you were to follow all of those things — I mean, we’ve been together for almost nine years — you would think we’ve broken up like times 50 times.”</p><p><a href=#>In January 2023</a>, Ariana also addressed rumors that she and the Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras frontman had an open relationship, as costar <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a> informed Sandoval in the Pump Rules season 10 trailer that <a href=#><strong>Katie Maloney</strong></a> was making false claims about them. “We don’t have an open relationship,” she tweeted at the time. “I’m really not that cool. Thought that was obvious.”</p><p>While Sandoval was previously dating former costar <a href=#><strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a> before his relationship with Ariana, Raquel has been <a href=#>romantically tied</a> to several of her Bravo castmates over the years. She began dating <a href=#><strong>James Kennedy</strong></a> in 2016 and later got engaged in May 2021. However, the two <a href=#>called it quits</a> in December of that year.</p><p>In the summer of 2022, she went on several dates with SUR manager <strong>Peter Madrigal</strong> before hooking up with Schwartz during Scheana and <a href=#><strong>Brock Davies</strong></a>’ Mexico wedding weekend in August, months after he and Katie<a href=#> announced their split</a> in March 2022.</p><p>“In the moment, there was momentary passion in the air,” Schwartz told <a href=#>Us</a> in February 2023. “I kind of disappeared into that kiss, I’ll be honest. It was kind of a transformative moment. In terms of any long-term romance with me and Raquel, I don’t know how much chemistry is there.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later that month, Raquel mirrored her former fling’s words, telling <a href=#>Us</a> that they have “more of a friendship” than a romantic relationship.</p><p>Scroll below for everything you need to know about Sandoval, Ariana and Raquel’s cheating scandal:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwbC5jKyYp5yfq66tedGaqK6dnGK5psLIrKqsZZOdsqLAyKeeZquTlrulrctmnK%2Bdoq7BqbXNoGStp12gu7DDjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

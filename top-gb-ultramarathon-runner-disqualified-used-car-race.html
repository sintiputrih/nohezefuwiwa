far faster than Olympic champion <a href=#>Usain Bolt</a> at his peak.</p><p>After claiming third place prize with a time of seven hours and 25 minutes, Dr Zakrzewski then posed for pictures with her medal.</p><p>The issue has been referred to UK Athletics, the <a href=# aria-label="BBC (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a> reports.</p><p>A pal of Dr Zakrzewski said she felt sick and was sorry for any upset.</p><p>The director of the GB Ultras race Wayne Drinkwater said he had received information after the ultramarathon that a runner had gained an “unsporting, competitive advantage during a section of the event”.</p><p>He said: "The issue has been investigated and, having reviewed the data from our race tracking system, GPX data, statements provided from our event team, other competitors and from the participant herself, we can confirm that a runner has now been disqualified from the event having taken vehicle transport during part of the route."</p><p>He added a report of the disqualification had been submitted to the Trail Running Association, which provides the licence for the event and is an associated member of UK Athletics.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Athletics</h2></p><p>He said: "The matter is now with the TRA and, in turn, UK Athletics (UKA) as the regulatory bodies.”</p><p>Third place in the race, which was on April 7, has now been given to Mel Sykes.</p><p>Ms Sykes, an NHS podiatrist, took to Twitter to brand her race rival as a "cheat".</p><p>She said: "The sad thing in all this is that it completely takes the p**s out of the race organisers, fellow competitors and fair sport.</p><p>"How can someone who knows they have cheated cross a finish line, collect a medal/trophy and have their photos taken?!"</p><p>When asked how Dr Zakrzewski had been caught, she replied: "Too many people noticed things were amiss and contacted the race organisers separately so they had to launch an investigation."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/running-womens-marathon-glasgow-commonwealth-810932802.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/scottish-doctor-won-womens-event-4520591.jpg><p>Data from the race, uploaded to Strava by&nbsp;Dr Zakrzewski and shared on Twitter by&nbsp;Ms Sykes, revealed she&nbsp;"hadn’t taken the race route", Ms Sykes alleged.</p><p>She also claimed&nbsp;there was a section where Dr Zakrzewski's "HR/cadence/speed didn’t add up".</p><p>Scottish Athletics chairman David Ovens said: "It is very disappointing to hear this, given Joasia's had such a successful period over the last few years.</p><h2>'VERY DISAPPOINTING'</h2><p>"I hope she can put this behind her and that there is an innocent explanation and she can resume her successful career."</p><p>Dr Zakrzewsk’s running friend, Adrian Stott, who has been in touch with her since the event, said she had been travelling for 48 hours from <a href=#>Australia</a> and had only arrived the night before the race.</p><p>He said: "The race didn't go to plan. She said she was feeling sick and tired on the race and wanted to drop out.</p><p>"She has cooperated fully with the race organisers' investigations, giving them a full account of what happened.</p><h2>'GENUINELY FEELS SORRY'</h2><p>"She genuinely feels sorry for any upset caused."</p><p>Mr Stott added: "Joasia has been a great ambassador for British sport and has inspired so many women to run and achieve their goals."</p><p>Ms Zakrzewski has an impressive record competing in ultramarathons.</p><p>In February this year she set a new world record by running 255 miles in 48 hours at the Taipei Ultramarathon in <a href=#>Taiwan</a>.</p><p>Taking part in the IAU World 100km Championships for Great Britain, she won the individual silver in 2011 and bronze in 2014 and 2015.</p><p>She also represented Team <a href=#>Scotland</a> at the <a href=#>Glasgow</a> 2014 Commonwealth Games where she took part in the marathon event.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She won a 24-hour event held in Australia in 2020 covering a distance of 236.561km.</p><p>Dr Zakrzewski also holds number of other records, including the Scottish 24-hour record, the British 200k and the Scottish 100 miles record.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2014-commonwealth-games-58-strong-110874856.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK570qmmq6xfbIZxgJhva2isn6V6qK6MrqOtqpGirrOt06Gmp2WiqruvsdFmm6KroaqurbXFopydZaWosqV5wpqpZqqRmLJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

As a result of the incident, the teen lived with guilt, confessing, "I was certain I was going to hell for the premarital sex. Today, I am merely certain that I hope that's not the case."</p><p>The actor also revealed in "Greenlights" another shocking event that happened just a few years after. McConaughey wrote that he was "molested by a man when I was eighteen while knocked unconscious in the back of a van." After opening up about these experiences, however, McConaughey said, "I've never felt like a victim."</p><p>When <a href=#>Tamron Hall</a> noted that he doesn't delve into specifics of these incidents in his memoir, McConaughey replied in 2020, "Ultimately, there's nothing that I feel is constructive about the details ... that could be relatable to other people."&nbsp;He went on to say that he worried that the information would just become tabloid fodder. While McConaughey added that he doesn't identify as a victim, he did say that he had been "victimized in those two situations."</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.

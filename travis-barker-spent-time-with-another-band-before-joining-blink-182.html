They are known for performing in superhero costumes and masks with matching identities. Barker — known as The Baron Von Tito — joined as the band's drummer in 1994. As reported by <a href=#>Loudwire</a>, Blink-182 and The Aquabats crossed paths in 1997 when they toured together. During that time, Blink-182's members had ongoing issues that escalated into a fight.</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>Drum Magazine</a>, Scott Raynor had an alcohol addiction that affected the band's performances. He was urged by his bandmates to go to rehab to help him with his alcoholism, which he did, but he was ultimately <a href=#>let go from the band</a>. According to Raynor, it was the best decision for Blink-182 at that time. He left while Blink-182 was in the middle of a tour, and they needed a replacement immediately. Barker replaced Raynor for the tour and was able to learn the setlist in less than an hour (via <a href=#>Planet Radio</a>). He left The Aquabats and officially joined Blink-182 soon afterward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFkG1nbGxfqb%2BiwsisZJuZoqCys3nSqZynrF2ptq6xjLCgraBdlruwwMeeqWaakaOxbq7En6arnV2fvKq6yKeeZpqcnruseZBxaWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

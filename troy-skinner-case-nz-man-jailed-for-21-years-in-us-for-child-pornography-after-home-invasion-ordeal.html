A 28-year-old New Zealand man has been sentenced to 21 years in prison in the US for the production of child pornography of a 13-year-old girl he met online and travelled across the world to see in an attempted home invasion.
Troy Skinner made headlines in 2018 after travelling thousands of kilometres from Auckland to the US state of Virginia and being shot while trying to smash his way into the home of the teenage girl."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The platform aims to operate as a global network of gamers, building functions into its system that encourage community and communication.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/xbR11RjiydY8SLkj721ynzXBrhU=/16x12/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/7NINUHRKAOUVE3NM3MOGWBEHOA.jpg"><p>Right at the outset, evidence showed Skinner initially believed she was 18. “Nope, I’m 16,” she responded. Skinner replied: “Americans always act older than they are.”</p><p>There were thousands of pages of chats between the two over the following months. There were also obscene internet memes and, in one case, disturbing rape “fan fiction” featuring a teacher and a student.</p><p>Evidence in the case showed they exchanged sexually explicit images. When the sexual contact occurred during video calls, Skinner would capture and save the video without the girl’s knowledge.</p><p>In late January 2018, they talked about meeting in real life. And they talked of the age of consent. Skinner talked of her coming to New Zealand: “It’s 16 in New Zealand. It would be fine. It’s 16,” he told her.</p><p>Not here in the US, she replied. If she’s under 18, then he would have to be under 21.<br>In March 2018, Skinner’s victim told him she had celebrated her 17th birthday – in reality, her 14th birthday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/9vY5Nxc_4nh7B-DorHynyU15nLc=/16x21/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/MTPPFQYQW7IKCBEFYAPKI4WX2Y.jpg"><p>On June 20, 2018, Skinner flew out of Auckland for Washington Dulles International Airport, about 40 kilometres west of Washington DC. Arriving on June 21, he bought a Greyhound bus ticket to Richmond.</p><p>Travelling the next day to the rural township of Goochland where his victim lived, Skinner approached the house with duct tape, pepper spray and a folding pocket knife.</p><p>His first attempt was through a sliding glass door into the basement. He failed but his efforts alerted the girl and her mother. Alarmed, the pair retreated upstairs, where the mother called the girl’s father.</p><p>The girl’s mother took with her a pistol and confronted Skinner as he tried to enter through a different door.</p><p>Ignoring warnings to leave, he picked up a paving stone and hurled it through a window, smashing a pane. As Skinner reached inside the house, his upper body inside the door and hand stretching for the interior lock, the girl’s mother fired two shots, hitting him in the neck.</p><p>When officers of the Goochland Country Sheriff arrived, they found Skinner lying in a neighbour’s yard.</p><p>Nearby, they found his two mobile phones. On one, he had the copy of a graphic sexual video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpKe8unnSpKCnppWneqSt0p5kp7Jdoq6vecmaoKWdlGKzsL6Ma2hmsZWWv7R5yKdkrqtdm7yzecKhoKWcXaW8s7rOoKmaqJiueqKy056pZqCforJutc2vmKyhn6N6sL7DnpilZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

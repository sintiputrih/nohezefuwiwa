One of these is the character of Penny.</p><h2 id=h-was-penny-from-top-gun-maverick-in-the-first-top-gun-film data-injectable=false>Was Penny from Top Gun: Maverick in the first Top Gun film?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Penny-Top-Gun-Maverick.jpg><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=153 data-injectable=false>Simply put, no. You won’t remember Penny from the first&nbsp;Top Gun&nbsp;film as she wasn’t in it. She was, however, mentioned through dialogue in the film.</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>Back in the ‘80s classic&nbsp;Top Gun, Tom Cruise’s character Maverick was in a relationship with Charlie, who Kelly McGillis plays. Neither the actress nor her character shows up in the new sequel. The reason? McGillis herself explained to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET</a>&nbsp;that she simply didn’t get the call. However, she’d long left the Hollywood life behind to get “sober,” partly for the sake of her two daughters, Sonora and Kelsey Tillman. She continued:</p><p>“I think just&nbsp;my priorities in life changed […] It wasn’t like a major decision that I made to leave, it was just that other things became more important. I love acting, I love what I do, I love doing theater, but I don’t know. To me, my relationships to other people became far more important than my relationship to fame.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How Penny Fits Into Top Gun: Maverick</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Top-Gun-Maverick-Tom-Cruise-Jennifer-Connelly.jpg><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>Now Maverick is in an on-again, off-again relationship with Penny Benjamin, played by Jennifer Connelly. The single mother who owns a bar near the Top Gun school location is an entirely new character for the sequel, so you’ll be wasting your time if you’re looking for her in the original.</p><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=824 data-injectable=true>The only mention of Penny Benjamin before Top Gun: Maverick comes in a throwaway line during the original movie. This occurs when CDR Tom “Stinger” Jardian, played by James Tolkan, reprimands Maverick for a dangerous mid-air maneuver, which also features the iconic line: “Your ego is writing checks your body can’t cash.” In the commander’s monologue, he mentions Maverick making a pass at an “admiral’s daughter” as part of the pilot’s long list of past transgressions.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=135 data-injectable=false>While it won’t be from Top Gun, you may recognize Connelly from her roles in Requiem of a Dream, The Rocketeer, and A Beautiful Mind.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorpqrXaWyr7rYZp2rp51iwbC8jKCsp2WdlsOmvsicomahnmLBqbGMn6Crq6RiwbC8jKCsp2WWnrmuew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Her father, Ethan Hawke had a comment about the video as well.</p><p>One of the hosts of The View asked him how he felt about his daughter being naked in her newest music video. To which he responded, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"She’s a full grown woman. She can do as she pleases. She can tell her truth.

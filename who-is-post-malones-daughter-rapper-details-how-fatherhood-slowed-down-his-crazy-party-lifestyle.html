Instead, he prefers smaller gatherings with close friends, avoiding the wild and raucous social settings he used to frequent. “The difference is I don’t rage in social settings,” he explained. “It’s usually me and a buddy and we just stay up super late until sunrise and were just drinking and sitting out in the car and hanging out listening to music."</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Who is Alaqua Cox's boyfriend?

I’m such a t**d.’ But now I don’t and it’s been surprisingly easy because this is the stuff I’ve always wanted to do. I’m a homebody.

What Happened To Sarah On ‘The Bachelor’?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Sarah was on season 26 of&nbsp;The Bachelor with&nbsp;<strong>Clayton Echard</strong>. The two formed a fast connection, and Clayton gave Sarah a group date rose during week two. She then had a one-on-one with Clayton during week three, where their connection intensified and she got another rose. During week six, Sarah got another one-on-one date. At that point, though, Clayton began questioning whether she was ready for the commitment that he was hoping for after the show. Another contestant,&nbsp;<strong>Mara Agrait</strong>, got in Clayton’s head with claims that Sarah wasn’t on the show for the right reasons, and Clayton started fearing that Sarah’s young age would be an issue for them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>On the date, Sarah got emotional and began crying, which eventually led to Clayton apologizing to her. He wound up giving her the one-on-one date rose and then <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eliminating Mara</a> at the rose ceremony. However, Sarah wound up getting eliminated on the next group date during week 7, just one episode before hometowns.</p><h2>2.

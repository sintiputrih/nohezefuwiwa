According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IndieWire</a>, the sixth chapter in the long-standing horror franchise is set to take place in New York City, marking the first time that the franchise features a film that doesn’t take place in Woodsboro or the state of California in general.</p><h2 id=h-why-is-scream-6-set-in-a-different-location data-injectable=false>Why is Scream 6 set in a different location?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/scream-5-sidney-prescott.jpg><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>According to franchise star Jenna Ortega, the sixth movie’s Ghostface is rumored to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">be the most aggressive version</a> of the masked killer yet. As a result, it is believed that the location change occurred in order to give the franchise a fresh spin and to present a new setting to viewers. In the past, smart-minded horror fanatics have been able to figure out who the killer is early on, especially in 2022’s Scream. That likely took a toll on writers and producers who spent months drawing up the plot.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>Now with a new setting and the opportunity to keep the audience guessing more than ever before, it appears as though the location change will shake up the fundamentals of the horror franchise that we’ve all come to know for so long.</p><h2 id=h-how-will-the-change-affect-the-movie data-injectable=false>How will the change affect the movie?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshotter-YouTube-ScreamOfficialTrailer2022Movie-151.png><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>As previously mentioned, the location change will definitely create a new environment of scares and murders that the audience has yet to feast their eyes upon. Rather than Sidney and the gang patrolling around the town of Woodsboro, a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mix of both new</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">returning characters</a> will bounce around the streets of New York while trying to protect themselves from Ghostface.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>Eventually in horror movies, a premise has the tendency to become stale if the same scenario is repeated over and over. While the movies in the Scream franchise are certainly fun, perhaps a new setting will allow the creators to venture out into uncharted waters and expand the overall fear factor.</p><p data-characters=121 data-current-count=121 data-injectable=false>We’ll have to wait and see how the different location affects Scream 6 when it slashes into theaters on March 31, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGxXZ7Abr%2FCq5yapV1rerSx02agp2WRYrGqssWeqZ6mpGK5sK%2FAraCopl2Wu6V5x6iuZq%2BZoblutdNmmJ%2BelZjBbsDHnmSmp6aesnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Without scribes, letters would not have been written or read, royal monuments would not have been carved with cuneiform, and stories would have been told and then forgotten.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-was-the-invention-of-the-plow-so-important-to-the-sumerians></span>Why was the invention of the plow so important to the Sumerians?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Why was the invention of the plow so important to the Sumerians? The Mesopotamian seeder plow was invented around 1500 BCE. It was used by the <b>Mesopotamians to make farming more efficient than doing it all by hand</b>. This allowed for farming to be more efficient, which was the main goal of this invention.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-the-babylonians-communicate></span>How did the Babylonians communicate?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Babylonians had <b>a written language</b> that they used for trade and communication. â€¦ The Babylonians used the same cuneiform system of pressing triangular shapes into soft clay.

Sumerians invented or improved a wide range of technology, including <b>the wheel, cuneiform script, arithmetic, geometry, irrigation, saws and other tools, sandals, chariots, harpoons, and pint</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-contributions-of-babylonians></span>What are the contributions of Babylonians?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Among the most important contributions of Babylonia are the <b>first ever positional number system</b>; accomplishments in advanced mathematics; laying the foundation for all western astronomy; and impressive works in art, architecture and literature.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-inventions-did-the-babylonians-invent></span>What inventions did the Babylonians invent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>We can thank the Babylonians for pioneering discoveries like <b>the wheel, the chariot, and the sailboat</b>, as well as the development of the first-known map, which was engraved on clay tablets.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-contributions-of-babylonian-civilization-with-regards-to-science-and-technology></span>What are the contributions of Babylonian civilization with regards to science and technology?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The ancient scientists who lived in the city made important discoveries in mathematics, physics and astronomy.

The Babylonians were the first to <b>recognize that astronomical phenomena are periodic and apply mathematics to their predictions</b>. Tablets dating back to the Old Babylonian period document the application of mathematics to the variation in the length of daylight over a solar year.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-evidence-about-babylonian-society-does-the-code-provide></span>What evidence about Babylonian society does the Code provide?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Hammurabi Code reveals that people in <b>ancient Babylonia owned private property and needed laws and contracts to protect their property rights</b>.

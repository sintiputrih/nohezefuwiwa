John Wayne Gacy.”</p><p>The voice actor and Poehler, 50, <a href=#>expanded their family after their 2003 nuptials</a>.

Their divorce was finalized in 2016.</p><p>Earlier this year, Arnett praised the way the pair <a href=#>successfully transitioned into their new coparenting relationship</a>. “It’s been almost 10 years and my kids are so lucky that Amy is their mother. And I’m so lucky that we’re such a huge part of each other’s lives, even more so than we were five years ago,” he told The Guardian in February.</p><p>At the time, Arnett admitted <a href=#>how “excruciating” it was to return to work amid the split</a>. “Just brutal, brutal, brutal,” the <a href=#>Arrested Development</a> alum explained about working on season 4. “I was driving to the set one day and I pulled over to the side of the road and cried for an hour.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The “SmartLess” podcast host was briefly linked to interior designer <strong>Elizabeth Law</strong> in late 2016 following his divorce.

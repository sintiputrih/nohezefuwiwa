Jada Pinkett Smith and her husband, Will Smith, have been secretly separated since 2016. The news of their now-seven-year-long separation comes as a shock to the public, which has witnessed the pair booed up on red carpets, oversharing intimate details about their relationship, and standing up for each other when a petty comedian made a stupid joke and got slapped for it. There were a few signs to marital discord that the power couple couldn’t hide, though. In 2020, <a href=#>Jada Pinkett Smith brought herself to the Red Table</a> and revealed that she’d had a relationship with R&B singer <a href=#>August Alsina</a> while “temporarily” separated from her husband.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnm649xf000j3b825oslgzw0@published data-word-count=103>While Will and Jada promised to lay their cards on the table a few years back, hindsight proves that a lot was left unanswered.<strong> </strong>Why did the couple separate and keep it a secret? Why did she decide to share the news? Were she and Will in an open relationship before the separation? What exactly is an entanglement? As such, we took it upon ourselves to map out the complete timeline of Will and Jada’s relationship, from meeting on the set of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to sitting across from each other at the Red Table<strong> </strong>to Jada’s latest act of oversharing.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcoygsrc000x3h68q09cdmy6@published data-word-count=53><strong>1994</strong>: Will Smith and Jada Pinkett meet on the set of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air when Jada auditions to play Smith’s girlfriend.

She and Will live “completely separate lives” and function as divorced people do. She adds that the marriage ruse persisted because they were “just not ready yet” and “still trying to figure out between the two of us how to be in partnership … In regards to how do we present that to people? We hadn’t figured that out.” Their breakup had many contributing factors, Jada says.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnm7bkld00173b828clnfxh2@published data-word-count=78>“Why it fractured … that’s a lot of things. By the time we got to 2016, we were just exhausted with trying. I think we were both kind of just still stuck in our fantasy of what we thought the other person should be,” she explains. “I made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce. We will work through … whatever. I just haven’t been able to break that promise.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnonxvpl000c3b877zuypyo7@published data-word-count=104>That same day, <a href=#>People</a> publishes an exclusive interview with Jada, where she claims Chris Rock previously attempted to ask her out amid rumors that she and Will were calling it quits, without mentioning when exactly. “And this particular summer, Chris, he thought that we were getting a divorce,” she says. “So he called me and basically he was like, ‘I’d love to take you out.’ And I was like, ‘What do you mean?’ He was like, ‘Well, aren’t you and Will getting a divorce?’ I was like, ‘No. Chris, those are just rumors.’ He was appalled. And he profusely apologized, and that was that.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnoo06j2000h3b87y7u35z45@published data-word-count=181><strong>October 13, 2023: </strong>NBC milks the clips from Jada’s upcoming prime-time interview with Hoda Kotb for all it’s worth. In a new <a href=#>teaser</a>, viewers are treated with new details regarding the Slap. Jada says she didn’t initially realize that Smith actually made contact, assuming that Rock had ducked away. In the full interview that airs later that night, Jada also describes being shocked to hear Will’s infamous call to “Keep my wife’s name out your f—ing mouth!” After all, she and Will haven’t “called each other husband and wife in a long time.” Jada also recalls a conversation she had with Rock immediately following the incident at the 2022 Oscars. They spoke as the best documentary reels played. “Chris looks to me and he says, ‘Jada, I meant no harm,’” she <a href=#>remembers</a>. “I’m just out of it because I’m really worried about Will. And Will’s still talking. Now he’s mad because Chris is talking to me.” She believes the Slap doesn’t represent Will as a person: “It’s not him whatsoever.” She says she and Will have not spoken to Rock since.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnoo0chf000m3b87mpkpaf9g@published data-word-count=65>The jaw-dropping event led some to believe that Jada was the “bad guy” in the aftermath. “My honest opinion about that is that narrative had more to do with the false narrative that I helped to create on the Red Table,” she says. In her eyes, the public viewed her as “the adulterous wife” who “forced him to go to the table and sit there.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnoo806q000q3b879peb2hbq@published data-word-count=26>“And now look at what she’s done,” she continues. “She has the power with an eye roll to make him go up and slap somebody onstage.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnpc84wd000c3b870d4o4t8l@published data-word-count=92>Ultimately, Jada is asked why she and Will don’t just get an amicable divorce. “We don’t want to,” she answers. “We love our family. And we love each other. It’s more of a life partnership. Now, ten years from now, Hoda, who knows?” She adds that the pair are currently focused on “deep healing” because of “everything that’s transpired.” And as for the possibility of a full reconciliation in the future? “He’s getting old!” Jada says with a laugh. “Who’s going to be there for him, Hoda? It’s going to be me.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnsyblnc000c3b7mfz3uxzm2@published data-word-count=62>October 14, 2023: Will Smith responds to the separation revelations in an email to the New York Times included in a profile about Jada’s memoir. “When you’ve been with someone for more than half of your life,” he <a href=#>writes</a>, “a sort of emotional blindness sets in, and you can all too easily lose your sensitivity to their hidden nuances and subtle beauties.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnsyeag1000h3b7mpxp6t67i@published data-word-count=95>October 16: 2023: Jada takes herself to the Today show once again for a live, in-studio interview following her explosive prime-time NBC special with Hoda Kotb. This time, she says she is no longer divorced in theory … i.e., the couple in question is getting back together. “This whole journey, as difficult as it’s been, has brought Will and I closer in such an authentic way,” she tells the morning show. “Instead of trying to be a thing, it’s tearing all of that down and finding what’s true between us.

I came into that with very specific ideas that blocks me from seeing Will as who he is. He can’t be this perfect, idealized husband. I have to be able to accept him for the human that he is. He accepts me for the human that I am, and we want to love each other there.” She suggests they might even “live in the same house” now.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnm7kbah00263b823f4jvoze@published data-word-count=6>This post has been updated throughout.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clnnl8nvj00000igrwcp51mgo@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Jada Pinkett-Smith Is the Queen of Contradictory Spin</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clnls5iw9000k0ih6aqlxmqn0@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith Aren’t As Entangled As We Thought</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl26gbu9s0000jinak3008ts3@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Red Table Talk Season Five Is Here to Heal</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>A Timeline of Will and Jada’s ‘Bad Marriage for Life’</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmny4tculZKylmam1brbAnZhmqJmjuKbA02aqpqGknXqiwcauqq1lkaHAqrrAZquipZWhtq%2BxjaGrpqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

More than a week since the article ran, rumors are still circulating in Hollywood about other potential client departures and the possibility for other firms to pick up some previously-accounted-for big names. –by CelebrityAccess Staff Writers</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGivnZZ6sb7ErKCdnZ6peri10a2qnKCRm8GmvtJmmqilnZq7tb%2BMrKuiql2qvW7A0aism6SVYraveceoo6Wxp6S8pXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Champions Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn then make their way out. Zayn says Pretty Deadly are owed congratulations, Zayn says he didn’t expect them to win, however they won five minutes ago and are still celebrating, by his calculations they’ve overstayed their welcome by five minutes. Prince says despite beating five teams their hair still looks drier and better than that mess right there. Wilson says that when they become new tag team champions they will celebrate for even longer, they say even longer about six times together. Zayn asks Owens if he hears this. Owens says that Zayn has been telling him to calm down but listening to them makes him “WANT TO SCREAM AND RUN DOWN THERE AND PUNCH THEM IN THEIR STUPID FACES!” Zayn says that they should and Owens and Zayn run towards the ring as Pretty Deadly flee the area.</p><p>We cut to backstage where Paul Heyman asks Roman Reigns if he has spoken with Jey Uso. Reigns says no and asks Heyman who the tribal chief is, reigns says that when Jey is tribal chief people will reach out to him, but right now people need to reach out to him.

Waller references how Charlotte ended Asuka’s undefeated streak at WrestleMania 34. Waller asks Charlotte is she will become a 15 time women’s champion. Charlotte says since they’re talking numbers, she has Asuka’s number.</p><p>Charlotte and Waller are interrupted by Bianca Belair who makes her way out to the ring.

Charlotte says she may have stepped away but she never ran. Charlotte says she’d been defeated and picked herself up 14 times, and that she’s a champion with or without a title and she asks if Belair can say the same. Belair says she’s the longest reigning women’s champion of the modern era, and she didn’t need to win the title 14 times to do it. Belair says she will be ringside for Charlotte and Asuka’s match, and that the title will come back to her, Belair drops the mic and leaves the ring.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Paul Heyman approaches Jey Uso backstage. Heyman apologizes for telling him the truth last week. Heyman has Jimmy does not miss with his kick, he meant to kick Reigns at Night of Champions just like he meant to kick Jey last week.

Reigns gets the Kentucky crowd to acknowledge him and Jey Uso then immediately makes his way out to the ring. Reigns says the crowd wants answers and asks Jey if he’s in or out. Jey tells Reigns to tell him. Jey points to Heyman and says it’s either Heyman or himself. Reigns says when Jey’s tribal chief he can pick anyone he wants to be wise man, but Heyman is his, he’s there to help Reigns, not the Bloodline. Reigns says he got them to the promised land, and it’s Jey’s job to keep them there. Reigns says they have been grooming Jey for over three years now, and that he’s meant to lead, just not yet. Reigns again says that the problem is Jimmy Uso.</p><p>Jimmy Uso then walks out and tells Jey that the problem is their cousin. Jimmy tells Jey that Reigns is using him.

Reigns asks Heyman who the only man to have a problem with Jey being named right hand man was. Jey then looks at Jimmy who stands there with his head down. Jey turns to face Jimmy and ask him if it’s true and Jimmy says that it is true. Jey says this whole time Jimmy has been doubting him, that he expects that from Reigns but not Jimmy. Jey says all he has heard his whole life is to listen to his older brother, that all his life he has been competing with Jimmy. Jey says a blessing happened in disguise, Jimmy got hurt and Jey stepped up. Jey says he became main event Jey Uso, and it’s all beause of Reigns.</p><p>Jey Uso tells Jimmy that Jimmy is out and then Jey says he’s out too and Jey Uso superkicks Roman Reigns to an incredibly loud pop. The Usos take Sikoa out of the ring.
